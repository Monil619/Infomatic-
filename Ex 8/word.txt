Diplomacy Before and After Conflict
By Marc Grossman
Conflict is a universal condition,' older than diplomacy. While conflict is a constant in human
history, the nature of armed conflict, and especially the nature of 21st-century warfare, has been
transformed. General Rupert Smith identified these changes in his book The Utility of Force:
""The ends for which we fight are changing; we fight amongst the people; our conflicts tend to
be timeless; we fight so as not to lose the force; on each occasion new uses are found for old
weapons; the sides are mostly non-state.""2
The nature of 21st-century diplomacy is also changing. To be successful, diplomats must
simultaneously shape, act upon, and react to global challenges. As Hans Binnendijk and
Richard Kugler of the National Defense University argue, no single problem, danger, or threat
holds the key to the world's future. What matters is their interaction and the simultaneity of our
responses.3
The definition of victory, too, is different today. Twenty-first-century national security success
will encompass a comprehensive definition of security, and will be achieved by the broadest
simultaneous application of all elements of national power. This is the key to understanding
Philip Bobbitt's concept of ""preclusive victory,"" which he describes as ""anticipatory,
precautionary attention to possible futures,"" requiring an expansive and integrated approach to
modern diplomacy, defense, and development. A diplomatic strategy designed to produce
preclusive victory will include conflict prevention, successful negotiation, deterrence, the
preparation for conflict should all else fail, and efforts to establish order, ensure stability, and
promote political and economic pluralism after conflict.
Diplomats have always been participants in both the prevention and management of conflict and
its aftermath. The conflict prevention side of diplomacy occupied much of my time at the State
Department from 1993 to 1997 as the Department's Executive Secretary and U.S. Ambassador
to Turkey. Postconflict diplomacy was a defining issue of the last third of my career at State as
Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs and as Under Secretary of State for Political
Affairs from 2001 to 2005. I have tried to draw upon my experiences and observations to
discuss here the scope and complexity of modern diplomacy, the methods and goals needed to

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775200 Date: 08/31/2015
prevent conflict, diplomacy's role when conflict is or seems to be unavoidable, and the
contribution diplomacy can make to restoring stability following conflict.
Diplomacy and Conflict Prevention
Thanks to the efforts of scholars and practitioners, we can now make better use of the methods
and theory of conflict prevention. The United States Institute of Peace and the Woodrow
Wilson International Center for Scholars are two among many institutions that have taken a
leadership role in these efforts. Michael Lund, a practitionerscholar, notes that the present
uncoordinated and patchy nature of preventive diplomacy reflects the absence of any accepted
international conflict prevention regime or system of governance—that is, of agreed upon
arrangements through which geographic jurisdictions are allocated, functional responsibilities
are assigned, norms and procedures are formulated, and actors are held accountable for their
responsibilities.' He asks the crucial question to all those who seek to ""coordinate and
rationalize"" a system of preventive diplomacy: where should responsibility for the tasks of
preventive action be located—early warning, the decision to act, the formulation of a response,
or the provision of bureaucratic and political support? Should it be horizontal, across different
organizations or actors, or should it be vertical, up or down their chains of command?6
An example of conflict prevention that meets Lund's tests was the effort undertaken by the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), in close collaboration with the European Union
(EU) and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and supported by the
United States, to avoid civil war in Macedonia in 2001. It is difficult now to recall that, until
September 11, 2001, the possibility of civil war in Macedonia was a leading international
headline. This successful campaign of conflict prevention was defined by the remarkable
personal and institutional cooperation between the NATO Secretary General Lord Robertson
and the EU High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy (and a former
NATO Secretary General) Javier Solana. I spoke often during this period to Lord Robertson,
Solana, and Ambassador James Pardew, whom President George W. Bush and Secretary Colin
Powell appointed as the U.S. representative to the effort and who, along with Francois Leotard,
the EU Special Envoy, played a crucial role in negotiating and implementing the Ohrid
Framework Agreement.
As a direct participant, senior NATO official Mark Laity stated that there are insights about
modern diplomacy and conflict prevention to be drawn from this effort, including the need for
personal and institutional teamwork, the importance of early engagement in trying to head off
violence, the need to choose the right people for tasks of this kind (including 21st-century
diplomats who can act ""unconventionally""), and the necessity of being able to apply appropriate
force quickly.'
Diplomacy When Conflict Is or Seems to Be Unavoidable
When diplomacy fails to prevent conflict, the role of the diplomat changes. The new
requirement may be to justify the use of force when all efforts to avoid conflict fail or to seek to

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775200 Date: 08/31/2015
address the underlying source of conflict when force is or seems to be inevitable and
imperative.
The February 1999 diplomatic negotiations in Rambouillet, France, were designed to show the
world that NATO and the Contact Group were willing to make one last effort to avoid using
military force to stop Slobodan Milosevic's attacks in Kosovo. I was in Rambouillet as Assistant
Secretary of State for European Affairs to support Secretary Madeleine Albright. After the first
day or so of the meeting, there was so much chaos that I urged Secretary Albright to depart
Rambouillet and leave the ""negotiating"" to those of us more junior. My strategy was that by not
being present, the Secretary of State— and the administration—could keep a distance from an
outcome that might be unacceptable to the United States. The Secretary had a different vision.
Albright hoped Rambouillet would end the brutality against the Kosovars, but she was also
prepared for the meeting to fail, and thereby all options for avoiding military conflict would be
exhausted. Her idea was that we had to be seen to be doing everything we could diplomatically,
including her continued presence, so that if Rambouillet was a failure, there could be no further
excuses against taking military action.
Secretary of State James Baker had pursued a similar strategy before the first Gulf War in 1991.
Baker relates in his memoirs, The Politics of Diplomacy, that President George H.W. Bush had
concluded the United States should offer a meeting in Washington for Iraqi Foreign Minister
Tariq Aziz followed by a Baker trip to Baghdad to show America's commitment to avoiding
war if possible. Baker writes that he thought this proposal had three merits: it would give the
administration one last diplomatic opening to avoid war; it would shore up domestic support for
conflict; and it would show that, as the deadline for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait neared, the
administration was doing something other than just preparing for war. The President's offer
turned into the famous meeting between Baker and Aziz on January 9, 1991. As Baker recounts,
""I was under no illusions. I assumed the talks would be unsuccessful and that within a matter of
days, we would be at war.""8
In 2001-2003, the State Department leadership generally saw Iraq as a diversion from
Afghanistan and not central to the war on terror. Saddam Hussein was a dictator and a
menace— but ""in a box,"" posing no immediate, direct threat to the United States; focus should
be kept on defeating al Qaeda in Afghanistan and supporting the new Afghan government.9 Iraq
had been a source of tension and disagreement inside the State Department since the beginning
of the administration, and there were some who sought to move the policy from support for
""smart"" United Nations (UN) sanctions toward an aggressive posture against Saddam.
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger wrote in Years of Upheaval about the second term of the
Nixon administration that State Department culture emphasizes negotiability, which is a
consciousness of what the other side will accept.' Kissinger did not consider this trait a
particular positive at the time, and the department's culture of negotiability did not serve as a
good guide to institutional behavior for most of the senior State officials who participated in the
interagency debate leading to the invasion of Iraq. If that was so during the period surrounding
1970s détente with Russia, diplomatic efforts with the Shah of Iran, and the crisis in the Middle
East and the resulting 1973 war, this culture of negotiability no longer served as a good guide to

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775200 Date: 08/31/2015
institutional behavior for most of the senior State officials who participated in the interagency
debate leading to the invasion of Iraq. We took part in planning for the conflict and its aftermath
assuming—or hoping—that events either at home or abroad would turn preparations for conflict
into successful coercive diplomacy rather than the military action that was ordered in the spring
of 2003.
The State Department's Director of Policy Planning, Richard Haass, observed that while he was
""60:40 against going to war. . . no organization could function if people left every time they
lost out on a 60:40 decision.""' Haass was operating under the belief that Iraq had weapons of
mass destruction; if he had known they did not, he says he would have been 90:10 against the
war.
And no senior Department of State officer resigned in protest. The department sought instead to
try to recreate the successful Gulf War coalition of President George H.W. Bush and argued that
the United States and its allies might compel Saddam to submit through a deployment of force
in the region in early 2003. If this failed, there should be a sustained diplomatic effort to create
a broad coalition to move militarily later in 2003. This possibility of a broad international
coalition lost all relevance on January 20, 2003, when the French government announced that it
would never support a second UN Security Council resolution to authorize the use of force in
Iraq.
Diplomacy in Preparation for Conflict
Once conflict is inevitable or is initiated, one job of diplomats is to support military
commanders in getting what they need to make conflict as short as possible, with the fewest
casualties for Americans, allies, and civilians. This was the objective that the United States
pursued in Turkey before the first Gulf War, which resulted in President Turgut Ozal's support
of American efforts. The diplomatic effort to prepare for conflict in Kosovo also involved the
whole of the U.S. Government and the governments of the NATO Allies. To pursue a
successful bombing campaign, diplomats in many NATO countries arranged for overflight and
support for Allied forces. A similar effort by U.S. diplomats took place before the invasion of
Afghanistan in 2001. American and allied diplomats worked closely with nations surrounding
Afghanistan, including forging contacts with Central Asian states on security issues for the first
time in order to achieve transit, overflight, and bed-down rights for American and coalition
forces before the October 7, 2001, beginning of action in Afghanistan.
Before the invasion of Iraq in March 2003, and especially after January 20, 2003, a similar
effort began in earnest. Diplomats supported U.S. Central Command commander General
Tommy Franks in order to make the war as short and successful as possible and to limit
American, allied, and Iraqi civilian casualties. American diplomats worked with military
commanders to seek access to facilities for U.S. forces and to participate in the public
diplomacy effort to gain as much support as possible for the armed liberation of Iraq. American
diplomats and Pentagon officials again paid particular attention to Turkey in an effort to
convince the Turks to allow the 4th Infantry Division to transit that country to create a northern
front in the battle against Saddam's forces. Although the State Department worried about the

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775200 Date: 08/31/2015
size of the Department of Defense (DOD) request to Ankara, it worked closely with both
civilian and military authorities at the Pentagon to try to meet the need that had been identified
by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Joint DOD—State diplomacy, however, could not
overcome a negative vote in the Turkish parliament, which reflected strong public opposition to
the war.
The way the debate about using force is carried out inside the government influences attitudes
and actions during and after conflict as well as future decisions on whether or not to use force.
Military force may restore security, but it cannot resolve political or cultural sources of conflict.
As Rupert Smith writes, ""We are engaging in conflict for objectives that do not lead to a
resolution of the matter directly by force of arms, since at all but the most basic tactical level
our objectives tend to concern the intentions of the people and their leaders rather than their
territory or forces.""' Smith argues that the civil-military structure designed to make political-
military decisions is ""deeply problematic"" and distorts decisionmaking in many ways.13 In his
book, Smith imagines a debate between British Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and
Ministry of Defense (MOD) officials about how to address the genocide taking place over a
number of weeks in Rwanda during the summer of 1994.
FCO: What can we do in the face of events in Rwanda?
MOD: What do you want us to do?
FCO: We ought to act. Something must be done. We can't have people being massacred. As a
permanent member of the UN Security Council we cannot be seen to be doing nothing.
MOD: So you want us to use military force?
FCO: Yes.
MOD: To do what? To stop the killing?
FCO: Yes. Exactly.
MOD: Who do you want us to fight? We are not clear who is doing the killing: is it tribe on
tribe, or is it a force found _from a tribe? And Rwanda is a big country. Where do we start?
Kigali, presumably, it's the capital and we would want an airhead.
FCO: Well, there must be an international force, of course.
MOD: And what would be the British aim in joining the force?
FCO: To play our part as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
MOD: Is Britain to lead the force?
FCO: No, it should be led by the UN—a proper UN mission.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775200 Date: 08/31/2015
MOD: That will take some time to assemble, so it will probably be too late to stop the killing.
FCO: Then the mission should be aimed at bringing postconflict order.
MOD: OK But we need to be clear how many British troops are currently available. Given our
deployments in Ireland, Bosnia and a few other places, not many.
FCO: What do you suggest?
MOD: What are our government's priorities? Is contributing to this force a higher priority than
these other tasks we are already undertaking?
FCO: Probably not.
MOD: In that case, these UN forces always lack expeditionary logistic support. And if we want
to speed up the deployment of this force, offering a logistic unit would probably be the most
valuable contribution.
FCO: Will that put our soldiers at risk?
MOD: Hardly any.""
Many American diplomats will recognize this imaginary conversation, having participated in
something like it dozens of times since the fall of the Berlin Wall. In the American debate, the
issue also quickly focuses on who pays the bills. It is worth stating, at least in the American
case, that officials at the Pentagon and DOD often were legitimately frustrated by the State
Department's inclination to promote military missions for the Pentagon and the Armed Forces
in an increasing number of situations that were important, but not vital, to U.S. national
interests. While this readiness to volunteer U.S. military forces to solve problems around the
world was a direct result of the lack of civilian capacity to do the jobs required, it leads to
understandable consternation among those in uniform.
Diplomacy and Restoring Stability Following Conflict
There are many issues—defeating extremism, promoting pluralism, bringing the benefits of
globalization to those who have not yet benefited, living sustainably on the planet,
nonproliferation— that will be part of any definition of successful 21st-century diplomacy. But
getting postconflict diplomacy right—creating the conditions for a preclusive victory—may be
the most crucial of all. This is not an easy assignment. The concept of success can be redefined
after the fact, further complicating the assessment. Successful democratic governance and
economic development cannot be delivered on a certain date, and therefore the need for time
and patience is a necessity on the ground. However, patience is limited in home countries, and
""fatigue"" often sets in. Thus, the potential for failure is high. Industrial war produced winners
and losers; today's lines are not so clearly drawn, and the timeline may be longer.
Rupert Smith again brings clarity to this assessment:
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775200 Date: 08/31/2015

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775200 Date: 08/31/2015
We intervene in or even decide to escalate to, a conflict in order to establish a condition in
which the political objective can be achieved by other means and in other ways. We seek to
create a conceptual space for diplomacy, economic incentives, political pressure and other
measures to create a desired political outcome of stability, and if possible democracy. . . . if a
decisive strategic victory was the hallmark of interstate industrial war, establishing a condition
may be deemed a hallmark of the new paradigm of war amongst the people.15
Smith's point can be pressed even further by recognizing the additional distinction between a
military operation carried out following Smith's rules and the ambiguity inherent in trying to
create the conditions Smith identifies as objectives. Christopher Schnaubelt has noted that a
typical military operation will have unambiguous geographic boundaries (areas of
responsibility) and will assign specific units to be responsible for every inch of ground or cubic
foot of airspace. There is an obvious chain of responsibilities and expected actions between
each individual Soldier or Marine on the ground and the commanding general. Nothing
comparable exists for economic development in governance tasks, which tend to be assigned by
function rather than local geography or rigid hierarchy of authority.16
Postconflict diplomacy was among the defining diplomatic issues of the last third of my career
at the State Department.
In the aftermath of the first Gulf War in 1991, almost 500,000 Kurds fled to the mountains
between Iraq and Turkey. Stranded in harsh conditions, they began to starve by the thousands
each day. I was then the Deputy Chief of Mission in Turkey. Inspired by the leadership of
Ambassador Morton Abramowitz, American diplomats, followed by American military forces
and then an international coalition of governments and nongovernmental organizations, initiated
Operation Provide Comfort (which became Operation Northern Watch). This was not just a
""whole-of-government"" but a ""whole-of-theinternational- community"" campaign to provide
humanitarian assistance and then return the Kurds to their homes in Northern Iraq. Once home,
they needed to be protected, and for 11 years, the United Sates and some of its allies, including
Turkey, worked on the ground there to recreate a functioning society and then protected this
area from Saddam by enforcing a no-fly zone.
These years were also punctuated by activity in the Balkans. As Richard Holbrooke recounts,
some of the pre-Dayton negotiations with Bosnian leader Alija Izetbegovi took place in my
residence while I was Ambassador to Turkey:7 As one of Holbrooke's successors as Assistant
Secretary for European Affairs, I watched the effort made by Ambassadors Robert Gelbard and
James Dobbins to implement the Dayton Accords by applying whole-of-government efforts in
postconflict post- Yugoslavia. I picked up the diplomatic thread again as Under Secretary of
State for Political Affairs promoting reconciliation, development, political progress, and
nationbuilding in Kosovo.
Other postconflict diplomacy efforts in Haiti, East Timor, and Liberia called upon the resources
of the United States and other governments to try to create the conceptual space for
development and sustained peace. The U.S. effort in Colombia, too, highlighted the need to
focus on an integrated and cross-sectoral approach, which included disarmament,
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775200 Date: 08/31/2015

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775200 Date: 08/31/2015
demobilization, and reintegration of former combatants and promoted justice in postconflict
society. But the main events in modern diplomacy's postconflict paradigm are Afghanistan and
Iraq.
The key to understanding U.S. diplomacy in postconflict Afghanistan and Iraq is to recall the
profound disagreement inside the U.S. Government, especially between DOD and State, about
whether the United States should engage in ""nationbuilding,"" a policy President Bush had
campaigned against in 2000. State Department professionals were generally proud of the effort
the United States had made in nationbuilding and in peacekeeping, supporting the deployment
of U.S. military forces to participate, for example, in the Multinational Force and Observers in
the Sinai and in peacekeeping and nationbuilding activities in East Timor, Haiti, and the
Balkans. Most believed that nationbuilding, properly funded and executed, was an effective
long-term tool of integrated modern diplomacy for the United States.
The effort to create a new Afghan government after the overthrow of the Taliban was a piece of
classical diplomacy carried out in the 21st-century context.'8 Secretary Powell directed
Ambassador Dobbins to support the regional negotiation hosted by the Germans in Bonn in
2001 to create a new Afghan government. To succeed, Dobbins worked with all the key players,
including representatives from Iran, to support a major role for the United Nations and put
Hamid Karzai in position to lead a new Afghanistan.' But, as Dobbins has written, the ""Bush
Administration, having overthrown the Taliban and installed a new government in Kabul,
determined that American troops would do no peacekeeping and that peacekeepers from other
countries would not be allowed to venture beyond the Kabul city limits. Public security
throughout the rest of the country would be left entirely to Afghans, despite the fact that
Afghanistan had no army and no police force.""2°
The struggle over nationbuilding also hampered American attempts to get sufficient amounts of
U.S. or international assistance to Afghanistan. Washington accepted the diffusion of
responsibility there, with the British taking charge of counternarcotics, the Italians reforming
the justice sector, and the Germans training police. This satisfied the need for burden-sharing
but did not lead to success. In addition, postconflict resources focused by the United States on
Afghanistan were small compared to other recent postconflict situations, even including
Kosovo.' American diplomats who followed Dobbins to the Embassy in Kabul over the years
faced the legacy of this lack of attention and underinvestment.22
The State Department participated at many levels in the National Security Council—led planning
for postconflict Iraq. Much of the planning was detailed, but focused on lessons learned from
the first Gulf War. The department's Future of Iraq Project, while important, would not have
solved Iraq's postwar problems. State did not have the capacity to take responsibility for the
immediate postconflict administration of Iraq, and its leadership agreed to the Executive order
creating a postconflict Iraq structure that reported to the Secretary of Defense.
There is no need here to recount the lost lives and lost opportunities so well chronicled by
others in the immediate postconflict period in Iraq, although Dobbins's argument that, looking
back, the Coalition Provisional Authority accomplished a great deal under trying circumstances
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775200 Date: 08/31/2015

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775200 Date: 08/31/2015
is worth noting.23 On July 1, 2004, the State Department did officially open (on time and on
budget) an Embassy in Baghdad, which allowed an expansion of diplomacy and led to more
comprehensive senior civilian-military cooperation.
There is another important lesson to draw from recent postconflict efforts: the need to have
adequate civilian capacity to respond, including a role for a revitalized U.S. Agency for
International Development (USAID). As this journal chronicled in an article' by Ambassador
John Herbst, the Secretary of State's Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization (S/CRS),
his office was mandated to develop a whole-ofgovernment civilian response to stability
operations and to ensure civilian-military coordination.
The Civilian Response Corps (CRC) is in an early stage, and ultimately will be made up of a
reserve component, in addition to the existing active and standby components. The personnel
are anticipated to represent the full range of sector experts: engineers, lawyers, judges,
corrections officials, diplomats, development experts, public administrators, public health
officials, city planners, border control officials, economists, and others. Currently, the active
and standby components that are being stepped up are drawn from State, USAID, and a core
group of domestic U.S. Agencies.
Once congressionally funded, the reserves would be drawn from state and local governments
and the private sector. Between January 2008 and May 2009, 56 CRC members deployed to 11
countries, including Afghanistan for planning purposes, and there are realistic plans to have 250
active members and 1,000 standby members ready to deploy by the end of 2010. There are now
at least 14 other countries with whom the United States allies that have a civilian peacebuilding
capacity—some including stability or civilian police, and employing wholeof- government or
""comprehensive"" approaches similar to that created by Washington. Several, in fact, have
higher budgets proportionate to their gross national products than America's.25
One way for State to further support the S/CRS effort would be to consider creating a new
personnel specialty: the ""expeditionary diplomat."" Washington's diplomatic personnel have, of
course, always been in one sense expeditionary; the majority of the Foreign Service is deployed
abroad the majority of the time. But the post-9/11 diplomatic experience, and especially the
effort in Iraq and Afghanistan, means that State needs to be more explicit about the
expeditionary nature of some of its future diplomatic work and should prepare a small but
significant number of people to serve successfully in the hardest places at a moment's notice.
Experience with the Provincial Reconstruction Teams in Iraq and Afghanistan, the lessons
learned with S/CRS, and the example of diplomats who have pursued careers in the toughest
posts should lead State leadership to conclude that this is a step worth taking. The first
requirement would be advanced training, some of it provided by DOD and some by the Central
Intelligence Agency, for those entering diplomats who believe they want to pursue this special
career path. These entering officers would make an explicit choice and understand that an
investment in their extra training would require their service in hard places, just as we now ask
diplomats who take the hardest languages— Chinese or Arabic, for example—to serve more
than one tour using their skills. Since these expeditionary diplomats will not need to meet the

same age and physical requirements as special operations in the military, the State Department
could allow people to opt in and out of this ""special force"" during their careers as long as they
have the proper training. This would allow flexibility across the institution and encourage those
who desire or whose family circumstances might change over time to participate as well. The
department would also need to make sure those taking this career path are recognized for a
career beyond the norm for Foreign Service and are promoted and rewarded.
The creation of S/CRS is a symbol of the comprehensive, simultaneous diplomacy needed for
the future, and this expeditionary diplomat could form the backbone of the State and USAID
commitment to the civilian response capacity. There are still key questions to be answered
about civilian capacity. In the face of a real world situation, will DOD really support a State
Department—led operation? Will Congress adequately fund S/CRS, including a reasonable
contingency fund? How will S/CRS and a resurgent USAID work together? Where will the
lines be drawn between immediate postconflict needs and nationbuilding? There seems to be no
question that the path is the right one, consistent with the administration's focus on diplomacy,
development, and defense. Success will come with clear direction and active implementation.
If we combine the observations made by several authors,' we arrive at this question: What
national policies, supported by adequate human and financial resources, will create the
conditions during and after war to bring about a preclusive victory? Nation building, post-
conflict reconstruction and stability operations, and counterinsurgency strategy (call it what we
will) will be part of modern diplomacy for years to come. Accomplishing this task does not
have to be an exclusively American responsibility, and, indeed, one of the goals of modern
American diplomats will be to make these efforts more international. But for the foreseeable
future, the United States will need to learn the lessons of its role in nation building from
Germany to Iraq."" These lessons include support for new institutions that bring all of the
elements of power and influence together in the same theater, at the same time, and in close
coordination so the United States and its allies and friends have a chance to succeed.28 As Philip
Bobbitt has written, ""The problem is the picture of warfare to which we cling. This picture
unfolds in this way: peace making by diplomats; war making by the Armed Forces; peace
building by [US]AID and reconstruction personnel. The reality of 21st"					
century warfare							
however	 is that all of these tasks must be performed simultaneously.""'						
While the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century can be observed and analyzed							
individually	 none of them can be solved without reference to the others. Diplomacy is not the						
answer to every question	 but it has utility both before and after conflict. As General Smith						
writes at the end of his volume:							
For the general purpose of all interventions is clear: we seek to establish in the minds of the							
people and their leaders that the ever present option of conflict is not the preferable course of							
action when in confrontation over some matter or another. This applies as much to the state							
possessing nuclear weapons or seeking to obtain them	 rogue or otherwise	 as it does to the *					
terrorist or the machete-wielding rebel; each is posing an armed threat to people to establish a							
condition in which to achieve its political goal. To do this	 military force is a valid option	 a					
lever of intervention and influence	 as much as economic	 political and diplomatic levers	 but to

be effective it must be applied as apart of a greater scheme focusing all measures on the one							
goal.3°							
The connection to the utility of a modern diplomacy is clear. Twenty-first-century diplomacy							
working to prevent conflict	 trying to get ready for it if it is inevitable	 or dealing with the					
consequences	 can be an effective tool of national security if it is adequately funded	 carried out					
by well-trained	 dedicated people	 focused on clear goals set by national leaders	 and backed by				
effective military force. This is the diplomacy of the future.

In 2006	 the rabbi was briefly held by Israeli police for urging his supporters to murder all Palestinians over the age						
of 13. Two years later	 according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz	 he signed <http://www.haaretz.com/print-					
edition/news/violence-follows-removal-of-trailer-from-west-bank-outpost-1.250450> a rabbinical letter in support of							
Israeli Jews who had brutally assaulted two Arab youths on the country's Holocaust Remembrance Day. That same year							
Shapira was arrested as a suspect in helping orchestrate <http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/news/the-king-s-							
torah-a-rabbinic-text-or-a-call-to-terror-1.261930> a rocket attack against a Palestinian village near Nablus.							
Though he was not charged	 his name came up again in connection with another act of terror when	 in January					
2010	 the Israeli police raided his settlement seeking vandals who had set fire to a nearby mosque. One of Shapira's						
followers	 an American immigrant	 Jack Teitel <http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0	8599	1934103	00.html> 	 has	
confessed to murdering two innocent Palestinians and attempting to the kill the liberal Israeli historian Ze'ev Sternhell							
with a mail bomb.							
What does all this have to do with Islamophobic campaigns in the United States? A great deal	 actually. Through						
New York-based tax-exempt non-profits like the Central Fund of Israel <http://www.haaretz.com/print-							
edition/features/akiva-eldar-u-s-tax-dollars-fund-rabbi-who-excused-killing-gentile-babies-1.2137> and Ateret							
Cohenim	 for instance	 the omnipresent Aubrey Chernick has sent tens of thousands of dollars to support the Yitzar					
settlement	 as well as to the messianic settlers dedicated to ""Judaizing"" East Jerusalem. The settlement movement's						
leading online news magazine	 Arutz Sheva	 has featured Geller as a columnist. A friend of Geller's	 Beth Gilinsky	 a			
right-wing activist with a group called the Coalition to Honor Ground Zero and the founder of the Jewish Action Alliance							
(apparently run <http://www.manta.com/c/mmzgtfs/jewish-action-alliance> out of a Manhattan real estate office)							
organized a large rally in New York City in April 2010 to protest the Obama administration's call for a settlement freeze.							
Among Chernick's major funding recipients is a supposedly ""apolitical"" group called Aish Hatorah that claims to							
educate Jews about their heritage. Based in New York and active in the fever swamps of northern West Bank							
settlements near Yitzar	 Aish Hatorah shares an address and staff with a shadowy foreign non-profit called the Clarion						
Fund. During the 2008 U.S. election campaign	 the Clarion Fund distributed						
<http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/J126Ak03.html> 28 million DVDs of a propaganda film called Obsession							
as newspaper inserts to residents of swing states around the country. The film featured a who's who of anti-Muslim							
activists	 including Walid Shoebat	 a self-proclaimed ""former PLO terrorist."" Among Shoebat's more striking statements:					
A secular dogma like Nazism is less dangerous than is Islamofascism today."" At a Christian gathering in 2007	 this						
former Islamic terrorist"" told the crowd that Islam was a ""satanic cult"" and that he had been born again as an

<http://www.jpost.com/Features/Article.aspx?id=96502> as a fraud	 whose claims to terrorism were fictional.						
Islamophobic groups registered only a minimal impact during the 2008 election campaign. Two years later							
however	 after the Republicans regained control of the House of Representatives in midterm elections	 the network					
appears to have reached critical mass. Of course	 the deciding factor in the election was the economy	 and in two years					
Americans will likely vote their pocketbooks again. But that the construction of a single Islamic community center or the

lice chief for	 in the words of the city's conservative Mormon mayor							
conduct[ing] his office as chief of police in exactly the same manner in which the communists operate their government.""								
From there	 Skousen sailed off to the far shores of the right-peddling conspiracy tracts like The Naked Communist	 and						
earning condemnation from his beloved FBI	 which accused him in an internal memo of ""promoting [his] own anti-							
communism for obvious financial purposes.""								
Skousen's vocal support for the far-right John Birch Society's claim that communists controlled President Dwight								
Eisenhower cost him the support of the corporate backers who had paid for his Red-bashing lecture tours. He went off the								
radar for several years	 returning during the late 1960s to accuse the Jewish Rothschild family of secretly bankrolling							
everyone from Ho Chi Minh to the civil-rights movement. By the late 1970s	 even the Church of Latter-Day Saints							
distanced itself from Skousen and his conspiracy theories. His work fell through the margins and might have disappeared								
entirely had Beck not revived it	 turning The 5000 Year Leap into the bible of the Tea Party movement. Alexander Zaitchik							
observed in his authoritative profile of Skousen on Salon that Skousen's renewed influence through Beck and the Tea								
Party ""suggests that the modern base of the Republican Party is headed to a very strange place.""								
The descent								
Besides influencing Beck	 Skousen's teachings inspired one of the Tea Party movement's most visible grassroots							
celebrities	 retired sheriff Richard Mack. I met Mack in February at a far-right rally just outside of Montgomery	 Alabama.						
On a makeshift stage towed into the middle of a rodeo arena by a pickup truck	 Mack recalled with reverence his							
mentorship by Skousen	 who he said taught him everything he needed to know about the constitution. Mack urged his							
spellbound audience to stockpile ammo and store food. ""If you control the food supply""	 Mack warned	 ""you control the						
people. And that's the first step to slavery.""								
Already a hero to conservatives for successfully suing the Clinton administration over the provision in the Brady Handgun								
Violence Prevention Act requiring law enforcement to conduct criminal-background checks of gun purchasers	 Mack							
reemerged in the Obama era as the archetypal local lawman who vowed to resist the tyrannical federal government.								
Along with a few dozen former and active military and law-enforcement personnel	 Mack helped form a self-styled Tea							
Party militia called the Oathkeepers. Galvanised by their fear of creeping socialism	 the Oathkeepers solemnly swore to							
refuse tyrannical federal orders such as cooperating with foreign troops and forcing Americans into concentration-camps.								
Because the group's members trained for combat	 the vow came with suggestion of armed resistance.							
Besides Mack	 the Oathkeepers attracted a coterie of militia-movement retreads into its ranks. The most well-established							
figure was Mike Vanderboegh	 a longtime militia fanatic who published a booklet in the mid-1990s entitled Strategy and							
Tactics fora Militia Civil War	 calling for sniper attacks on ""war criminals	 secret policemen	 rats."" With Obama in office					
Vandeboegh churned out anti-government screeds on right-wing blogs with renewed passion and supported his efforts by								
cashing in the $1	300 in federal disability compensation he received each month.							
For all the energy the far right exerted in its campaign to strangle Obama's agenda	 it was a Democrat who posed the							
greatest threat to the passage of healthcare reform. Representative Bart Stupak of Michigan had been in office since								
1993	 placing him among the senior leadership of the so-called centrist Blue Dog Democrats. When healthcare reform							
was introduced in Congress	 Stupak became the leader of an informal caucus of anti-abortion Democrats	 making him the						
de facto swing vote on the House version of the bill. By extension	 Stupak was the point man in the campaign to ensure							
that the bill would not allow federal funding for abortion for low-income women.								
But after close consultation with leaders of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops	 Stupak went a step further. He							
introduced a draconian amendment to block women from paying for abortions from even their own private insurance								
plans. The amendment	 which passed the House but was shut down in the Senate	 became a key sticking point in						
healthcare negotiations. ""He's a big hero now in the pro-life community""	 Deal Hudson - former Catholic issues adviser to							
George W Bush - told me in November 2009. ""Thanks to him	 this is the first time I can remember the pro-life Democrats							
having any power.""								
To the chagrin of the Republicans	 Stupak entertained offers of compromise from the Democratic leadership. According to							
Hudson	 the Catholic bishops were keen to see healthcare reform pass	 but only if the bill contained a clear provision						
forbidding patients from spending federal money on abortion. Finally	 in March 2010	 after pressure from Nancy Pelosi						
Obama agreed to sign an executive order forbidding the federal funding of abortion. Stupak had been mollified. Now he								
and his anti-abortion caucus pledged to deliver the swing votes the Democrats needed to pass the bill. As soon as reports								
seeped out declaring the imminent passage of healthcare reform	 major right-wing blogs like RedState.org churned out							
virulent denunciations of Stupak	 calling him a traitor and sellout. The blog comment sections filled up with dozens of							
diatribes referring to Stupak in language previously reserved for Dr George Tiller: ""Bart the Baby-Killer.""								
On 20 March 2010	 thousands of Tea Party activists surrounded the Capitol's Longworth Building in expectation of							
Obama's pep talk to the House Democrats and the healthcare vote. Democratic Representative John Lewis	 a hero of the							
civil-rights movement	 and Representative Barney Frank	 the first openly gay member of Congress	 passed through the					
crowd on their way inside the Capitol. ""Nigger!"" a demonstrator barked at Lewis. Another called Frank a ""faggot""	 eliciting							
laughter and cheers from nearby protesters. Meanwhile	 as another African-American Democrat	 Representative Emanuel						
Cleaver	 ascended the Capitol steps	 a protester who had been screaming at Lewis and Frank spat on his face.						
With the demonstration carried on into the night	 cries of ""Kill the bill!"" drifted into calls for violence. ""I would gladly stand							
with any of you men here and take these fascists down""	 a man in camouflage battle-dress uniform proclaimed in front of							
an amateur videographer	 pointing toward the Capitol. ""You haven't heard the last of me!""							
The next day	 Republican members of Congress emerged from the Longworth Building to salute the Tea Paters. The							
demonstrators cheered wildly for their proxies on the inside. Finally	 after hours of impassioned speeches on the House							
floor	 the bill passed. But the drama was hardly over.							
Republican Representative Joe Pitts	 an anti-abortion Catholic who co-authored Stupak's original amendment	 demanded						
a motion to bring it back to the floor for a vote	 a transparent exercise in grandstanding that was certain to fail. In							
response	 Stupak rushed to the podium with a stinging rebuke to Pitts and the Republicans. ""The motion to commit does							
not support life""	 Stupak declared. ""It is the Democrats who have stood up...."" Heckling from the Republican side							
interrupted his statement. As Stupak looked around the House chamber	 Representative Randy Neugebauer	 a right-wing						
Republican from Texas who openly supported the Birther movement	 began shouting at him from the backbench	 ""Baby						
killer!"" Other Republicans joined in	 parroting base insults.							
While the Republicans sank their heads in defeat	 some more militant devotees of the Tea Party movement called for a							
right-wing Kristallnacht. ""If you wish to send a message that Pelosi and her party cannot fail to hear	 break their windows""							
Vanderboegh of the Oathkeepers wrote on a far-right blog hours after the bill passed. ""Break them NOW. Break them and								
run to break again."" Within three days	 windows and doors at Democratic Party headquarters in New York	 Kansas and						
Arizona had been shattered.								
Meanwhile	 at least ten Democratic members of Congress reported receiving death threats. Images of nooses were faxed							
to the offices of Stupak and James Clyburn	 an African-American congressman from South Carolina. Representative							
Anthony Weiner	 an especially vocal proponent of healthcare reform	 received a menacing letter filled with white powder.						
The brother of Representative Tom Perriello	 another healthcare supporter	 had his home gas line deliberately sabotaged						
after a local Tea Party organiser posted his address online (he had meant to post the congressman's) and encouraged								
activists to ""drop by"" to express their anger about Perriello's recent vote. In Tucson	 Arizona	 the windows of Democratic						
Representative Gabrielle Giffords' office were shattered by shots from a pellet gun. And a brick was thrown through the								
window of Representative Louise Slaughter's office in New York as her voicemail filled with threats of impending sniper								
attacks.								
After the passage of the healthcare bill	 the Tea Party floated into a grey zone between authoritarianism and anarchy.							
Crusading to restore a holy social order	 they promoted disorder. Claiming to protect democracy	 they smashed windows						
of elected representatives. Warning of death panels	 they called in death threats. With the atmosphere of violence							
thickening	 Palin took to her Twitter account to issue a battle-cry: ""Don't Retreat	 Instead-RELOAD!"" Thus concluded the						
first phase of the Obama era that was to usher in a peaceable kingdom of bipartisanship."	"UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773028 Date: 08/31/2015

The rise of the Tea Party movement in the United States in the first twenty months of Barack Obama '5 presidency is
shaking the political establishment, a trend reinforced by the victories of its candidates in Republican Party primaries. But
where has the movement come from, and what is its inner life? Max Blumenthal
begin_of the_skype highlighting end of the_skype highlighting, author of ""Republican Gomorrah"", enters the heady
world of the Tea Party to unravel the mix of driven personalities, feverish rhetoric, toxic hatreds, and flirtation with violence
that fuel its sub-culture's insurgent activism.
""He will tell you that he wants a strong authority to take from him the crushing responsibility of thinking for himself. Since
the Republic is weak, he is led to break the law out of love for obedience. But is it really strong authority that he wishes?
In reality he demands rigorous order for others, and for himself disorder without responsibility"" - Jean-Paul Sartre, Anti-
Semite and Jew
I am not sure when I first detected the noxious fumes that would envelop the conservative movement in the Barack
Obama era. It might have been in April 2009, when I visited a series of gun shows in rural California and Nevada.
Perusing tables piled high with high-calibre semi-automatic weapons and chatting with anyone in my vicinity, I heard
urgent warnings of mass roundups, concentration-camps, and a socialist government in Washington. ""These people that
are purchasing these guns are people that are worried about what's going on in this country"", a gun dealer told me outside
a show in Reno. ""Good luck Obama"", a young gun enthusiast remarked to me. ""We outnumber him 100 to 1."" At this time,
the Tea Party movement had not even registered on the national media's radar.
In September 2009, I led a panel discussion at the University of California-Riverside about my book Republic Gomorrah
(Basic/Nation Books, 2009). Inside an auditorium filled with nearly 100 students and faculty, I sat alongside Jonathan
Walton, an African-American professor of religious studies and prolific writer, and Mark Takano, an erudite, openly gay

former Democratic congressional candidate and local community-college trustee. In the middle of our discussion, a dozen
college Republicans stormed the front of the stage with signs denouncing me as a ""left-wing hack"" while a hysterical
young man leaped from the crowd, blowing kisses mockingly at Takano while heckling Walton as a ""racist"". Afterward,
university police-officers insisted on escorting me to my ride after the right-wing heckler attempted to follow me as he
shouted threats.
Who was this stalker? Just a concerned citizen worried about taxes? His name was Ryan Sorba and he was an operative
of a heavily funded national conservative youth outfit, the Intercollegiate Studies Institute. Besides founding dozens of
Republican youth groups across the country, Sorba has devoted an exceptional amount of energy to his interest in
homosexuals. His intellectual output consists of a tract titled The Born Gay Hoax, arguing that homosexuality is at once a
curable disease and a bogus trend manufactured by academic leftists. Adding to his credentials, Sorba has a history of
run-ins with the law, he explained when I called him about the order.
My encounter with this aggressive right-wing cadre seemed a strange, isolated event. But the hostility turned out to be
symptomatic of the intensifying campaign to delegitimise President Obama and his allies in Congress. The right's days of
rage were only beginning.
The constellation
Through his first year in office, Obama seemed oblivious to the threat of the far right. He campaigned against
partisanship, declaring that there were ""no red states"" and no ""conservative America"". Apparently, he thought it was
merely a contrivance or myth that there were people who rejected science, demonised gays, assailed minority and
women's rights - not that they genuinely believed in what they said. Speaking of changing Washington, Obama seemed to
think that the entire history of politics since the rise of Ronald Reagan and the right and their strategies of polarisation was
not deeply rooted but a superficial problem attributable to certain ""divisive"" personalities, easily wiped away with gestures
toward bipartisanship. His view of the parties was that they were simply mirror images sharing fundamental beliefs but
separated by ""partisans"". The skilled and devoted community organiser could bring them together.
Many of his supporters in the media, often partisans of political wars over the years, reinforced and amplified his
innocence, proclaiming he was the one at last who could ""bridge the partisan divide"". Andrew Sullivan, a disaffected
conservative who once called critics of George W Bush policies ""fifth columnists"" but now fervently supported Obama,
wrote that the new president was destined to become ""a liberal Reagan who can reunite America"". This optimism
pervaded the White House as the new president and his aides sought out Republicans willing to vote for his programmes.
After all, why couldn't we all just get along?
In his autobiographical book The Audacity of Hope, Obama highlighted a key component of his political strategy: ""I serve
as a blank screen on which people of vastly different political stripes project their own views."" Once he was elected,
conservatives concluded that they could reverse Obama's strength by transforming him into a human tableau for the most
fearsome images they could conjure (see ""Barack Obama, the fallen messiah"", 23 December 2009).
Obama's multiracial background was crucial in cultivating resentment among the shock-troops. Those who rejected
Obama's legitimacy to serve as president on the basis of his background gave birth to the ""Birther"" movement that sought
to challenge his citizenship. The movement's most visible figure, and therefore the most eccentric, was Orly Taitz, a
dentist and self-trained lawyer who had immigrated from the former Soviet republican of Moldova to Israel before settling
in the conservative bastion of Orange County, California. Convinced by claims on the far-right website WorldNetDaily that
Obama planned to create a ""civilian national security force"", Taitz told me she ""realised that Obama was another Stalin -
it's a cross between Stalinist USSR and Hitler's Germany.""
After becoming transfixed by online conspiracy theories claiming Obama's family had forged his birth-certificate in Hawaii,
Taitz snapped into action. She filed a lawsuit in November 2008 with California's secretary of state Debra Bowen
demanding an investigation into Obama's eligibility to serve as president. Taitz's plaintiff in the case was Wiley Drake, an
Orange County radio-preacher and former second vice-president of the Southern Baptist Convention who once publicly
prayed for Obama's death. While her lawsuit went nowhere, and subsequent suits earned her angry rebukes from judges,
Taitz became an instant media sensation, delivering heavily accented screeds against Obama before friendly interviewers
from Sean Hannity to CNN's Lou Dobbs (the latter, described by Taitz as her ""greatest supporter"", was eventually fired as
an indirect result of his hosting of her).
In March 2009, the Texas Representative Randy Neugebauer signed on to a Birther bill proposing that future presidential
candidates must prove their citizenship before becoming eligible to campaign. The Birther movement had found its voice
in government and made an indelible impact on the Republican grassroots. By June 2009, 28% of Republican
respondents to a Kos/Research 2000 poll said they thought Obama wasn't born in the United States, while 30% ""weren't
sure"". ""Obama should be in the Big House"", Taitz shrieked to me, ""not the White House!""

When Obama announced healthcare reform as the first major initiative of his administration, the conservative movement
activated a campaign of demonisation - transformational politics - designed to turn Obama into the ""Other"", making him
seem as unfamiliar, and therefore as threatening, as possible. When the president urged the Congress to deliver a
healthcare-reform bill in 2009, the right staged a living theatre of political hatred which turned Obama's dream of
bipartisanship into a nightmarish version of Peter Weiss's MaraVSade. On 12 September 2009, tens of thousands of far-
right activists belonging to a loose confederation of anti-government groups called the Tea Party Patriots converged on
Washington's National Mall for a giant protest against the Obama healthcare plan. The date was significant: Fox News's
top-ranked talk-show host Glenn Beck had declared the birth of the ""9-12 Project"" to restore the sense of unity (and siege
mentality) that Americans experienced on 11 September 2001. But this time, Obama - not Osama - was the enemy.
While covering the rally, I witnessed sign after sign declaring Obama a greater danger to America's security than al-Qaida;
demonstrators held images that juxtaposed Obama's face with images of evildoers from Hitler to Pol Pot to Bin Laden;
others carried signs questioning Obama's status as a United States citizen. ""We can fight al-Qaida, we can't kill Obama"",
said an aging demonstrator. Another told me, ""Obama is the biggest Nazi in the world"", pointing to placards he had
fashioned depicting Obama and House of Representatives' majority leader Nancy Pelosi in SS outfits. According to
another activist, Obama's agenda was similar to Hitler's: ""Hitler took over the banking industry, did he not? And Hitler had
his own personal secret service police. [The community-organising group] Acorn is an extension of that.""
The seemingly incongruous Tea Party propaganda recalled signs waved by right-wing Jewish settlers during rallies
against Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and his support of the peace process, portraying him as an SS officer and as
the French collaborator Marshall Petain. In 1995, amid this provocative atmosphere, a young right-wing Jewish zealot
assassinated Rabin. The Israeli tragedy was a cautionary example of targeted hatred leading to violence.
Members of the Tea Party ""Patriots"" did not seem to care that their rhetoric was irrational, or that comparing Obama to
Hitler and Stalin was contradictory and obviously hyperbolic. Their motives were entirely negative. By purging government
of the multicultural evil that had seized power through illicit means (several activists told me they believed Acorn helped
Obama steal the election), they were convinced that a mythical golden American yesteryear would return. They had no
interest in building anything new or even articulating an agenda, much less discussing the merits of policies. The Tea
Party's primary concern was cultural purification - freedom from, not freedom to. Against the dark image of the president
and his liberal allies, Tea Party activists defined themselves as the children of light. The racial subtext was always
transparent.
The Tea Party's strategy rested on a guerrilla campaign of chaos and sabotage designed not only to intimidate Democrats
but also to disorient independent voters who might have supported healthcare reform. The Tea Paters were convinced
this would be an easy feat, since they believed the majority of the country was on their side - that they represented the
""real America"". At the 9-12 rally Matt Kibbe, one of the march organisers, told the crowd that ABC News was reporting
that 1 million to 1.5 million people were in attendance; ABC denied this, saying ""ABCNews.com reported an approximate
figure of 60,000 to 70,000 protesters."" Then one Dick Armey led the crowd in a chant of ""Freedom works! Freedom
works!"" Unknown to most of the Tea Paters, they were intoning the name of a corporate-funded Beltway advocacy-
group, not the battle-cry of Mel Gibson's version of William Wallace in Bra veheart.
Indeed, contrary to its image as a grassroots movement mobilised to stifle the machinations of Washington elites, the Tea
Party movement was the creation of a constellation of industry-funded conservative groups with close Republican ties.
The movement's leading puppet-master was the same Dick Armey, who directed resources and talking-points to the Tea
Party ""Patriots"" from his Washington-based advocacy group, FreedomWorks. Among the corporate clients of Armey's
lobbying firm, which he was forced to leave as a result of his involvement in the Tea Parties, was the pharmaceutical giant
Bristol Myers Squibb, a company with a clear interest in defeating healthcare reform. (Armey's other ""real American""
clients included the Marxist terror-cult, the People's Mojahedin of Iran, which received funding and assistance from
Saddam Hussein in order to launch terrorist strikes throughout the 1990s against Iranian civilian targets.) Armey collected
a consulting fee of $250,000 directly from FreedomWorks and $300,000 from allied astroturf front groups. FreedomWorks
paid out much of its money to an assortment of Republican political consultants.
The rumour
If Dick Armey was the Tea Party king, Sarah Palin was eager to be crowned the Tea Party queen. Just days after
Obama's inauguration, Palin abruptly quit her job as Alaskan governor to vie for the honour. Palin's motives for quitting
became clear when she inked a lucrative deal to write her political memoir Going Rogue, signed on as a regular
contributor to Fox News, and received $1 million an episode for a reality-show on cable television, ""Sarah Palin's Alaska"".
Palin's book-tour, which sent her through Middle America in a luxuriously outfitted bus, resembled both a presidential
campaign and a travelling carnival.

Whether or not Palin intends to run for president, her growing media presence has magnified her influence within the
Republican Party. Yet the ever-expanding Palin phenomenon was greeted with hostility by Republican politicos
desperately seeking to expand the party's base after the drubbing in 2008. Steve Schmidt, formerly John McCain's
campaign manager in the doomed presidential campaign of 2008, warned that Palin's nomination in 2012 would be
""catastrophic"" for the GOP. His doomsday prediction was backed by an Gallup poll in October 2009 revealing her as one
of the most polarising and unpopular political figures in the country with a disapproval rating of over 50%. Unfortunately for
Schmidt and other party pragmatists, those who approve of Palin represent the heartbeat of the Republican Party, its
most fervent activists, and cannot be dissuaded from following her, even if she is leading the party off a cliff.
A special congressional election in New York's heavily Republican 23rd district in November 2009 was the first major test
of Palin's power. Along with a parade of nationally recognised conservatives, Palin endorsed Doug Hoffman, an unknown
far-right third-party candidate closely allied with the Tea Party - in the process helping to force a popular moderate
Republican politician, Dede Scozzafava, from the race. In the end, Palin's ideological purge in upstate New York led to an
improbable Democratic victory, the first in that district in more than 100 years. After the disaster Palin and her allies
claimed victory, insisting they had at least hastened the purge of ideologically impure Republicans from the party. She
went on to endorse Rand Paul, the son of right-wing libertarian Representative Ron Paul and a candidate in Kentucky's
GOP senatorial primary; meanwhile George W Bush's vice-president Dick Cheney went out of his way to endorse Rand's
regular Republican opponent, Trey Grayson, the Kentucky secretary of state.
The self-described ""hardcore pro-lifer"" Palin followed the Tea Party script of avoiding social issues like abortion and gay
marriage in order to obscure the large presence of the Christian right within the movement's ranks, recasting herself
accordingly as a libertarian concerned primarily with issues of ""economic freedom"". She claimed the Democratic ""cap-
and-trade"" plan to limit carbon-emissions would harm the livelihood of blue-collar workers, and she assailed healthcare
reform as a Trojan horse for ""socialism"" (though she admitted her family ""used to hustle over the border"" to take
advantage of Canada's single-payer healthcare system). But no Palin attack had as much effect as the one she blasted
out on her Facebook page claiming the Obama healthcare plan included a provision for ""death panels"" that would
recommend euthanasia for severely ill patients like her Down syndrome-afflicted son, Trig. With the click of a button, Palin
transformed the tone of the healthcare debate from rancorous to poisonous.
The source of Palin's ""death panels"" smear was a practiced propagandist, former New York's lieutenant governor Betsy
McCaughey. When Bill Clinton introduced healthcare reform during his first term as president, McCaughey falsely claimed
in an article published in the New Republic that the plan would force consumers to drop their private plans and buy into
the government's programme (the article, widely circulated by Republicans, would go on to win a National Magazine
Award, only to be retracted years later by the New Republic's editors). Now she was back in the spotlight, pushing a
rumour that would be voted by the non-partisan fact-checking website Politifact.com as ""the lie of 2009"". McCaughey's
latest innuendo was boosted by the cult of political crank Lyndon LaRouche, which mobilised to push the rumour into the
mainstream.
In June 2009, one of LaRouche's top lieutenants publicly confronted Ezekiel Emanuel, the National Institute of Health's
chief bioethicist and brother of White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, accusing him of seeking to reintroduce Hitler's
T-4 programme to kill the handicapped through healthcare reform. ""President Obama has put in place a reform apparatus
reviving the euthanasia of Hitler Germany in 1939, that began the genocide there"", LaRouche staffer Anton Chaitkin
charged. Soon, LaRouche's followers were on street corners around the country with posters depicting Obama with a
Hitler moustache. At a townhall forum on healthcare reform hosted by Barney Frank, a Democratic Representative, a
LaRouche follower waved one of the Obama-as-Hitler posters and demanded: ""Why do you continue to support a Nazi
policy, as Obama has expressly supported this policy?""
Two months later, after Palin whispered the rumour on Facebook, prominent conservatives from former House speaker
Newt Gingrich to ranking Senate finance-committee member Charles Grassley, parroted her claims before audiences of
indignant Tea Paters. Not to be outdone, Glenn Beck devoted an extended rant on his show to the reality of death
panels. Beck, echoing the LaRouche cultists, accused Ezekiel Emanuel of ""the devaluing of human life, putting a price on
each individual."" He thundered, ""The death panel is not a firing-squad. Rationing is inevitable and they know it!""
The death-panel rumour served a variety of functions, all useful to the movement, but not necessarily to the Republican
Party. Most importantly, the rumour resonated both with hard-core libertarians who resented the very existence of the
federal government and Christian right activists who viewed the legalisation of abortion as a slippery-slope to government-
sponsored euthanasia. The hysteria it engendered helped repair the rift exposed by the Terri Schiavo charade in 2005,
when the evangelical conservative James Dobson publicly clashed with Armey, the libertarian leader, over the right of the
government to interfere in a private family matter of life and death.
The enemy

The slurring of Obama as a sort of sleeper-agent crypto-Muslim helped bring the neo-conservatives back into the fray.
The new neocon generation was led by Dick Cheney's daughter, Liz, who founded an anti-Obama advocacy group, Keep
America Safe, by leveraging donations from pro-Israel sources. Asked by CNN's Larry King about the Birther movement
that was challenging Obama's status as an American citizen, Liz Cheney remarked: ""One of the reasons you see people
so concerned about this is people are uncomfortable with having for the first time ever, I think, a president who seems so
reluctant to defend the nation overseas."" With the libertarians, Christian right, and the neocons seated around the same
table, united in resentment of the alien president, the conservative movement was whole again.
The experiments in ""terror-management theory"" developed by three professors of psychology (Sheldon Solomon of
Skidmore College, Jeff Greenberg of the University of Arizona, and Tom Pyszczynski of the University of Colorado) have
demonstrated the connection between fear of death and intensification of conservative attitudes. The findings help explain
the effectiveness of the death-panel rumour and insinuations by conservative figures that Obama was not truly American
and somehow sympathetic to Islamic terrorists. Indeed, these seemingly irrational smears were guided by tactical
reasoning, calculated to agitate voters with constant reminders of their own mortality. Whether or not independent voters
responded, the rhetoric of death kept the Tea Party crowd in a persistent state of panic and rage, ensuring a standing
army ready to fan out to rallies and town halls at the first sign of liberal malfeasance.
Obama's first year in office was marked by more than raucous protests; there were several disturbing murders committed
by far-right extremists. In April 2009, a 22-year-old neo-Nazi wannabe named Richard Poplawsi mowed down a Swat
team of Pittsburgh cops, killing three. Poplawski's best friend told reporters the young killer ""grew angry recently over
fears Obama would outlaw guns."" Later it was discovered that Poplawski had posted a video-clip to a neo-Nazi website
portraying Fox's Glenn Beck contemplating the existence of concentration-camps. (After a characteristically thorough
investigation, Beck conceded they were not real.) On another occasion, the killer posted a video promoting Tea Party
rallies. A month after the Pittsburgh bloodbath, Scott Roeder, a supporter of the militant anti-abortion group Operation
Rescue, shot Dr George Tiller to death while he prayed at his church in Wichita, Kansas. Tiller was declared fair game by
the anti-abortion movement because of his role as Kansas's only late-term abortion provider. During at least twenty-eight
episodes of Bill O'Reilly's ""O'Reilly Factor,"" O'Reilly had referred to Tiller as ""Tiller the baby killer"", a criminal guilty of
""Nazi stuff."" ""I wouldn't want to be [Tiller] if there is a Judgment Day"", O'Reilly proclaimed.
In August 2009, a middle-aged professional named George Sodini walked into a health club in suburban Pittsburgh and
gunned down three women. The major media outlets explained Sodini's motives away by homing in on passages in his
online diaries describing his loneliness, inability to convince women to have sex with him, and descent into chronic
masturbation. Nearly every publication omitted or ignored a long deranged entry in which Sodini projected his sexual
frustration onto Obama, whom he seemed to view as a symbol of black male virility and predation.
The day after Obama's election victory, Sodini wrote: ""Good luck to Obama! He will be successful. The liberal media
LOVES him. Amerika has chosen The Black Man. Good! In light of this I got ideas outside of Obama's plans for the
economy and such. Here it is: Every black man should get a young white girl ... Kinda a reverse indentured servitude
thing. Every daddy know when he sends his little girl to college, she be ... real good. I saw it. 'Not my little girl', daddy
says! (Yeah right!!) Black dudes have thier [sic] choice of best white?? [ellipses in original].""
In another posting to an anti-Clinton forum in 1994, during the height of the Republicans' Whitewater investigation, Sodini
revealed that he had purchased a bumper-sticker reading, ""Stop Socialism, Impeach Clinton,"" from a National Review ad.
A year later, Sodini ranted on an anti-government militia site: ""I am convinced that more drastic action is required to bring
the country back to the Constitutional order that it was 200 years ago. I don't think any group of political leaders will
achieve this for us."" Whether or not Sodini's murder-spree was motivated by his political passions, he was pathologically
death-driven and fixated on the phantasmagoria of right-wing imagery. In his final diary entry, Sodini proclaimed: ""Death
lives!""
The bible
More than any other media figure of the Obama era, Glenn Beck encouraged the campaign of racial demonisation and
conspiracy that consumed the Tea Party ""Patriots"". During a broadcast of ""Fox and Friends"", Beck opined that Obama
""has exposed himself over and over and over again as a guy who has a deep-seated hatred for white people, or the white
culture."" As evidence, Beck pointed to White House green-jobs czar Van Jones, an African-American former community
organiser who was eventually forced to resign as a direct result of Beck's crusade. From there, Beck targeted another
black Obama adviser, Valerie Jarrett, highlighting her ties to Acorn while upholding her and Jones as evidence of
Obama's ""socialist"" agenda. In another broadcast, Beck played an audio clip of unidentified African-Americans referring to
""Obama money"" as they collected welfare-cheques in Detroit. Then he showed footage of members of a Kansas City-
based youth group practicing a step show, a traditional African-American group dance apparently unfamiliar enough to

In September 2009, Beck relentlessly targeted Acorn, the rights new favourite hobgoblin, admitting that he intended to
use the poor people's advocacy group to distract his viewers from the healthcare debate. ""Trust me"", Beck said,
""Everybody now says they're going to be talking about healthcare. I don't think so."" (His statement was reminiscent of
Rush Limbaugh's scandal-mongering remark during the early Clinton administration: ""Whitewater is about healthcare."")
Beck promptly cued up a series of hidden-camera videos shot by conservative youth activists James O'Keefe and Hannah
Giles inside Acorn field offices.
In the videos, O'Keefe baited African-American staffers into making statements explaining that Giles, who claimed she
was a prostitute, could obtain low-income housing. O'Keefe edited in images of himself clad in an outlandish pimp
costume to create the impression that he was dressed that way during the meetings with Acorn; however, Giles later
admitted her partner had lied about wearing his costume to further incriminate Acorn. In the end, Acorn was exonerated of
all criminal wrongdoing.
In a separate incident O'Keefe was arrested and charged with a federal crime after he and several conservative pals
disguised themselves as telephone repairmen and attempted to wiretap phone-lines in the office of Senator Mary
Landrieu of Louisiana. Like Ryan Sorba, O'Keefe and his posse were movement cadres paid and directed by well-funded
conservative outfits; O'Keefe had been trained by the Leadership Institute, the right-wing youth group that nurtured
leading lights like Jack Abramoff, Karl Rove, Ralph Reed, and Jeff Gannon.
While O'Keefe and his buddies plea-bargained with prosecutors, Beck basked in his formula for success. His show earned
the highest ratings at Fox News, topping network franchises like O'Reilly and Sean Hannity. In the process, Beck's
opinions became firmly implanted in the nervous systems of Tea Party activists. ""Glenn Beck has taught us everything we
know"", a demonstrator at the 9-12 rally told me. ""He's opened our eyes to so much.""
But unlike the right-wing radio warhorses who helped usher in Newt Gingrich's Republican counter-revolution of 1994,
Beck was not an authentic product of the movement. When Rush Limbaugh first began dominating the AM airwaves,
Beck was mired in the world of mid-level commercial radio, delivering corny yarns about lesbians and celebrity trash in
hopes of becoming the next Howard Stern. By night, as he has tirelessly recounted, he medicated his anxiety with cocaine
and alcohol, destroying his first marriage in the process. ""We remember Glenn from the womanising, the drinking, the
drugs. Everybody who knew him at the time saw what a complete mess he was"", a shock- jock from Tampa, Florida, who
called himself Bubba the Love Sponge remarked to me during a broadcast of his nationally syndicated show.
Like Dusty Rhodes, the pseudo-populist demagogue of Elia Kazan's 1957 film, A Face in the Crowd, Beck was a self-
destructive drifter who might have been crumpled up with a bottle of Mad Dog 20/20 in an alleyway or been locked away
in a prison cell had fame not found him first. Beck was only able to stabilise his life when he made his escape from
freedom, marrying a conservative Mormon, converting to her religion, and transmuting his urge to abuse drugs into
conservative radio diatribes.
,When Beck first broke into television on CNN's Headline News Channel, he struggled to articulate a coherent political
worldview. If he distinguished himself from other big-time conservative hosts in any way, he did so through strained and
often snide attempts at humour, remnants of his failed radio career. Nevertheless, with help from his liberal agent,
Matthew Hiltzik, Beck snagged a primetime slot at Fox News in early 2009. Around this same time, Beck began promoting
the work of an arcane Mormon conspiracy-peddler named W Cleon Skousen, whom he described as his political lodestar.
Suddenly, Beck had something more to offer than irritable mental gestures.
Thanks to Beck's designation of Skousen's pseudo-historical tract The 5000 Year Leap as ""required reading"" on the
website of his 9-12 Project, and his promotion of the book on his show, the previously obscure Skousen became the
Hidden Imam of the Tea Party movement. By summer 2009, Skousen's Leap was among the top ten books on Amazon
and a fixture on literature tables at Tea Party gatherings. It went from selling a puny couple of thousand copies in 2007 to
selling over 200,000 copies in 2009. Just why the book generated such an instant appeal is difficult to understand. It is
little more than a slapdash of quotes from the Founding Fathers, often taken out of context and deliberately oversimplified,
to explain why America is the greatest nation in history. In the process, Skousen claims that church and state separation
is un-American, that ""coercive taxation"" is communist, and that marriage is the underpinning of a free society. Benjamin
Franklin, who wrote at length on the merits of ""amours"" with ""old women,"" and who famously solicited prostitutes and
fathered a s"							
n of out of wedlock	 was the ultimate authority Skousen quoted on the importance of marriage.							
Though Skousen claims the Founders as the world's foremost source of eternal wisdom	 he buttressed his points with							
fringe sources like the conspiracist Norman Dodd's screeds about the Illuminati. According to Skousen	 Dodd claimed that							
powerful influences congregating in the United States"" like the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds had forced the United								
States into the first world war. Skousen published Dodd's manifestoes in his obscure journal Freemen's Digest	 which he							
founded for the express purpose of propagating conspiracies.

Skousen's paranoid politics were an outgrowth of his participation in extreme anti-communist groups during the 1950s. He								
boasted of a close friendship with then-FBI director J Edgar Hoover and said he provided him with research on communist								
plots	 claims disputed by FBI historians. (During a recent interview	 Skousen's son	 Paul	 told me that contrary to rumours				
of Hoover's cross-dressing and homosexual dalliances	 he would set the top cop up on blind dates with live women.)							
Skousen was fired from his job as Salt Lake City's police chief for	 in the words of the city's conservative Mormon mayor							
conduct[ing] his office as chief of police in exactly the same manner in which the communists operate their government.""								
From there	 Skousen sailed off to the far shores of the right-peddling conspiracy tracts like The Naked Communist	 and						
earning condemnation from his beloved FBI	 which accused him in an internal memo of ""promoting [his] own anti-							
communism for obvious financial purposes.""								
Skousen's vocal support for the far-right John Birch Society's claim that communists controlled President Dwight								
Eisenhower cost him the support of the corporate backers who had paid for his Red-bashing lecture tours. He went off the								
radar for several years	 returning during the late 1960s to accuse the Jewish Rothschild family of secretly bankrolling							
everyone from Ho Chi Minh to the civil-rights movement. By the late 1970s	 even the Church of Latter-Day Saints							
distanced itself from Skousen and his conspiracy theories. His work fell through the margins and might have disappeared								
entirely had Beck not revived it	 turning The 5000 Year Leap into the bible of the Tea Party movement. Alexander Zaitchik							
observed in his authoritative profile of Skousen on Salon that Skousen's renewed influence through Beck and the Tea								
Party ""suggests that the modern base of the Republican Party is headed to a very strange place.""								
The descent								
Besides influencing Beck	 Skousen's teachings inspired one of the Tea Party movement's most visible grassroots							
celebrities	 retired sheriff Richard Mack. I met Mack in February at a far-right rally just outside of Montgomery	 Alabama.						
On a makeshift stage towed into the middle of a rodeo arena by a pickup truck	 Mack recalled with reverence his							
mentorship by Skousen	 who he said taught him everything he needed to know about the constitution. Mack urged his							
spellbound audience to stockpile ammo and store food. ""If you control the food supply""	 Mack warned	 ""you control the						
people. And that's the first step to slavery.""								
Already a hero to conservatives for successfully suing the Clinton administration over the provision in the Brady Handgun								
Violence Prevention Act requiring law enforcement to conduct criminal-background checks of gun purchasers	 Mack							
reemerged in the Obama era as the archetypal local lawman who vowed to resist the tyrannical federal government.								
Along with a few dozen former and active military and law-enforcement personnel	 Mack helped form a self-styled Tea							
Party militia called the Oathkeepers. Galvanised by their fear of creeping socialism	 the Oathkeepers solemnly swore to							
refuse tyrannical federal orders such as cooperating with foreign troops and forcing Americans into concentration-camps.								
Because the group's members trained for combat	 the vow came with suggestion of armed resistance.							
Besides Mack	 the Oathkeepers attracted a coterie of militia-movement retreads into its ranks. The most well-established							
figure was Mike Vanderboegh	 a longtime militia fanatic who published a booklet in the mid-1990s entitled Strategy and							
Tactics fora Militia Civil War	 calling for sniper attacks on ""war criminals	 secret policemen	 rats."" With Obama in office					
Vandeboegh churned out anti-government screeds on right-wing blogs with renewed passion and supported his efforts by								
cashing in the $1	300 in federal disability compensation he received each month.							
For all the energy the far right exerted in its campaign to strangle Obama's agenda	 it was a Democrat who posed the							
greatest threat to the passage of healthcare reform. Representative Bart Stupak of Michigan had been in office since								
1993	 placing him among the senior leadership of the so-called centrist Blue Dog Democrats. When healthcare reform							
was introduced in Congress	 Stupak became the leader of an informal caucus of anti-abortion Democrats	 making him the						
de facto swing vote on the House version of the bill. By extension	 Stupak was the point man in the campaign to ensure							
that the bill would not allow federal funding for abortion for low-income women.								
But after close consultation with leaders of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops	 Stupak went a step further. He							
introduced a draconian amendment to block women from paying for abortions from even their own private insurance								
plans. The amendment	 which passed the House but was shut down in the Senate	 became a key sticking point in						
healthcare negotiations. ""He's a big hero now in the pro-life community""	 Deal Hudson - former Catholic issues adviser to							
George W Bush - told me in November 2009. ""Thanks to him	 this is the first time I can remember the pro-life Democrats							
having any power.""								
To the chagrin of the Republicans	 Stupak entertained offers of compromise from the Democratic leadership. According to							
Hudson	 the Catholic bishops were keen to see healthcare reform pass	 but only if the bill contained a clear provision						
forbidding patients from spending federal money on abortion. Finally	 in March 2010	 after pressure from Nancy Pelosi						
Obama agreed to sign an executive order forbidding the federal funding of abortion. Stupak had been mollified. Now he								
and his anti-abortion caucus pledged to deliver the swing votes the Democrats needed to pass the bill. As soon as reports								
seeped out declaring the imminent passage of healthcare reform	 major right-wing blogs like RedState.org churned out

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773028 Date: 08/31/2015								
virulent denunciations of Stupak	 calling him a traitor and sellout. The blog comment sections filled up with dozens of							
diatribes referring to Stupak in language previously reserved for Dr George Tiller: ""Bart the Baby-Killer.""								
On 20 March 2010	 thousands of Tea Party activists surrounded the Capitol's Longworth Building in expectation of							
Obama's pep talk to the House Democrats and the healthcare vote. Democratic Representative John Lewis	 a hero of the							
civil-rights movement	 and Representative Barney Frank	 the first openly gay member of Congress	 passed through the					
crowd on their way inside the Capitol. ""Nigger!"" a demonstrator barked at Lewis. Another called Frank a ""faggot""	 eliciting							
laughter and cheers from nearby protesters. Meanwhile	 as another African-American Democrat	 Representative Emanuel						
Cleaver	 ascended the Capitol steps	 a protester who had been screaming at Lewis and Frank spat on his face.						
With the demonstration carried on into the night	 cries of ""Kill the bill!"" drifted into calls for violence. ""I would gladly stand							
with any of you men here and take these fascists down""	 a man in camouflage battle-dress uniform proclaimed in front of							
an amateur videographer	 pointing toward the Capitol. ""You haven't heard the last of me!""							
The next day	 Republican members of Congress emerged from the Longworth Building to salute the Tea Paters. The							
demonstrators cheered wildly for their proxies on the inside. Finally	 after hours of impassioned speeches on the House							
floor	 the bill passed. But the drama was hardly over.							
Republican Representative Joe Pitts	 an anti-abortion Catholic who co-authored Stupak's original amendment	 demanded						
a motion to bring it back to the floor for a vote	 a transparent exercise in grandstanding that was certain to fail. In							
response	 Stupak rushed to the podium with a stinging rebuke to Pitts and the Republicans. ""The motion to commit does							
not support life""	 Stupak declared. ""It is the Democrats who have stood up...."" Heckling from the Republican side							
interrupted his statement. As Stupak looked around the House chamber	 Representative Randy Neugebauer	 a right-wing						
Republican from Texas who openly supported the Birther movement	 began shouting at him from the backbench	 ""Baby						
killer!"" Other Republicans joined in	 parroting base insults.							
While the Republicans sank their heads in defeat	 some more militant devotees of the Tea Party movement called for a							
right-wing Kristallnacht. ""If you wish to send a message that Pelosi and her party cannot fail to hear	 break their windows""							
Vanderboegh of the Oathkeepers wrote on a far-right blog hours after the bill passed. ""Break them NOW. Break them and								
run to break again."" Within three days	 windows and doors at Democratic Party headquarters in New York	 Kansas and						
Arizona had been shattered.								
Meanwhile	 at least ten Democratic members of Congress reported receiving death threats. Images of nooses were faxed							
to the offices of Stupak and James Clyburn	 an African-American congressman from South Carolina. Representative							
Anthony Weiner	 an especially vocal proponent of healthcare reform	 received a menacing letter filled with white powder.						
The brother of Representative Tom Perriello	 another healthcare supporter	 had his home gas line deliberately sabotaged						
after a local Tea Party organiser posted his address online (he had meant to post the congressman's) and encouraged								
activists to ""drop by"" to express their anger about Perriello's recent vote. In Tucson	 Arizona	 the windows of Democratic						
Representative Gabrielle Giffords' office were shattered by shots from a pellet gun. And a brick was thrown through the								
window of Representative Louise Slaughter's office in New York as her voicemail filled with threats of impending sniper								
attacks.								
After the passage of the healthcare bill	 the Tea Party floated into a grey zone between authoritarianism and anarchy.							
Crusading to restore a holy social order	 they promoted disorder. Claiming to protect democracy	 they smashed windows						
of elected representatives. Warning of death panels	 they called in death threats. With the atmosphere of violence							
thickening	 Palin took to her Twitter account to issue a battle-cry: ""Don't Retreat	 Instead-RELOAD!"" Thus concluded the						
first phase of the Obama era that was to usher in a peaceable kingdom of bipartisanship.

													William F. Buckley	 who						
understood the political logic as clearly as Reagan had.							
As President	 Reagan flattered the extremists—he even delivered some admiring words about Skousen's Freemen						
Institute—but he saved his political capital for his real goals: undoing the fiscal underpinnings of New Deal-style							
government	 and redirecting U.S. foreign policy by battling the Soviet Union and its proxies around the world. He						
appointed moderates to positions of importance	 as when he made James Baker III	 Bush's close associate	 his first chief				
of staff	 rather than the far more ideological Edwin Meese III	 his former chief of staff from California. (As a top policy					
adviser	 Meese helped Reagan stack the federal bench with conservatives	 but he was otherwise eclipsed by Baker and					
Baker's deputy	 the pragmatic Reaganite Michael Deaver	 and his crusade	 as Attorney General	 to roll back civil-rights			
legislation largely failed.) When zealots in the Administration were exposed	 as in the Iran-Contra scandal	 Reagan					
skillfully evaded responsibility and replaced them with more centrist Republicans. And	 when he recognized in Mikhail						
Gorbachev a Soviet leader with whom he could undertake genuine efforts to reduce the nuclear threat	 Reagan pushed						
forward	 ignoring the complaints that he had become	 in the hard-liner Howard Phillips's phrase	 ""a useful idiot for Soviet				
propaganda.""							
Whatever misgivings may have arisen about him on the right	 Reagan achieved a dramatic conservative overhaul of the						
federal tax code	 a profound reconfiguring of the judiciary	 and a near-victory for the West in the Cold War. From the					
standpoint of the mainstream right	 the only problem with his legacy was that no other Republican could come close to						
matching his public appeal and political savvy. For the party of Reagan	 his departure was the beginning of a long decline						
and it is the absence of a similarly totemic figure	 during the past twenty years	 that has allowed the current resurgence of					
extremism. George H. W. Bush repelled right-wingers with his moderate tendencies—not least when	 in the face of fiscal						
calamity	 he broke his campaign pledge not to raise taxes. Bill Clinton inspired them to an almost ecstatic series of						
attacks	 and though there remained enough of an older conservative establishment	 personified by Senator Bob Dole	 to				
check some of the wildest charges	 the new Republican House majority after 1994	 pushed by such ideologues as Tom					
DeLay and Dick Armey	 had little interest in maintaining the center. They harassed Clinton	 forcing an impeachment even					
though polls showed that more than sixty per cent of the American people disapproved. George W. Bush seemed at first							
to have a bit of Reagan's conservative charisma	 but the right wing turned against him for failing to win the war in Iraq	 for					
his moderate position on immigration	 and for spending hundreds of millions of federal dollars to combat the financial						
collapse in 2008. When William F. Buckley died	 during the 2008 primary season	 it seemed to symbolize the end of a					
conservative era. David Klinghoffer	 a former literary editor at National Review	 lamented that ""urbane visionaries and					
builders of institutions"" such as Buckley have been replaced by media figures ""who make their money by stirring fears and							
resentments."" Conservatism	 Klinghoffer added	 ""has undergone a shift toward demagoguery and hucksterism	 and is				
now ruled by those he called ""the crazy-cons.""							
Some Republicans have tried to extend the Buckley tradition	 but to little effect. The commentator David Frum	 a former					
speechwriter for George W. Bush	 lost his job at the American Enterprise Institute after he complained about the						
Republicans' obstruction of health-care reform and called the right-wing surge a threat to conservatism. In June	 the						
congressman Bob Inglis	 of South Carolina	 a tough conservative who nonetheless backed Bush's financial bailout	 lost a				
vicious primary fight with a right-wing insurgent named Trey Gowdy. To his amazement	 Inglis was confronted on the						
campaign trail by voters who were convinced that numbers on their Social Security cards indicated that a secret bank had							
bought them at birth. ""And then	 of course	 he recalls	 ""it turned into something about the Federal Reserve and the				
Bilderbergers and all that stuff."" Not even Karl Rove can afford open dissent with the Tea Partiers. Appearing on Fox							
News the night of the recent primaries	 he described the Tea Party-backed Senate candidate in Delaware	 Christine					
O'Donnell	 as probably unelectable and said that some of her statements were ""nutty."" Instantly	 criticism came from					
Sarah Palin	 Rush Limbaugh	 and other right-wing Republicans. Within days	 he was back on Fox	 proclaiming himself ""a			
huge Tea Party fan	 endorsing O'Donnell	 and affirming that the National Republican Senatorial Committee would give					
her its full backing.							
So far	 Rove	 an unlikely dissident	 is the only prominent Republican leader to so much as gesture at stepping forward	 as			
Buckley and his allies did. Even strong conservatives like Inglis have been pushed aside	 as have such former G.O.P.						
stalwarts as Charlie Crist	 in Florida	 and Mike Castle	 in Delaware	 both beaten in the primaries by Tea Party candidates;			
Grist is now running a long-shot campaign as an Independent. Desperate for gains in the midterm elections	 the						
Republicans are neglecting the struggle it took to make politics safe for Reagan.							
Fifty years ago	 President Kennedy deplored the far right's ""counsels of fear and suspicion."" Today	 Obama's White					
House is still struggling to make sense of its enemies. In the absence of forthright leadership	 on both the right and the						
left	 the job of standing up to extremists appears to have been left to the electorate. Candidates like O'Donnell may prove						
too eccentric to prevail	 or voters may simply become disillusioned by politicians who campaign on their hatred of						
government. After the election	 mainstream conservatives may well engage in what Richard Viguerie has forecast as ""a						
massive	 almost historic battle for the heart and soul of the Republican Party."" (Already	 Rove and some leading Bush					
political operatives	 including the former Republican National Committee chairman Ed Gillespie	 have been quietly					
supplanting the battered G.O.P. establishment in the effort to raise funds for this year's candidates.) But	 according to a						
recent poll	 more than seventy per cent of Republicans support the Tea Party	 and it seems almost certain that a					
Republican Party that has unstintingly appeased the far right will enjoy a strong and perhaps smashing victory in the							
coming midterm elections.							
In 1906	 early in the Progressive era	 the humorist Finley Peter Dunne's fictional barroom sage	 Mr. Dooley	 put the social			
and political tumult of the day into perspective. ""Th' noise ye hear is not th' first gun iv a revolution	 Dooley remarked. ""It's						
on'y th' people iv th' United States batin' a carpet."" A century from now	 or even a year from now	 Americans may say the					
same about the Tea Party. For the moment	 though	 it appears that the extreme right wing is on the verge of securing a					
degree of power over Congress and the Republican Party that is unprecedented in modern American history. For							
defenders of national cohesion and tempered adversity in our politics	 it is an alarming state of affairs. •

Confounding Fathers
The Tea Party's Cold War roots.
by Sean Wilentz October 18, 2010
ann Beck's view of American history stems from the paranoid politics of the fifties.
A few months ago, the cable-television and radio host Glenn Beck began his Fox News show with one of his favorite
props: a pipe clenched between his teeth. ""I've got my pipe,"" he told his audience, his speech slightly muddled by the
stem, ""because we're going to speak about schoolish kind of things."" The theme of the day was ""Restoring History,"" and
Beck, looking professorial in a neat dark blazer and a pink button-down shirt, began the lesson by peering at a stack of
history textbooks and pronouncing them full of falsehoods, produced by ""malicious progressive intent."" Progressives, he
explained—liberals, socialists, Communists, the entire spectrum of the left—""knew they had to separate us from our
history to be able to separate us from our Constitution and God."" For the next hour, Beck earnestly explained some of the
history that ""is being stolen from us"": the depression of 1920, for example, or how conservative economics saved the
nation from the ""near-depression"" of 1946—crises that progressives don't want you to know about. ""You've been taught
one lie, I think, your whole life,"" he said.
For the fractious Tea Party movement, Beck—a former drive-time radio jockey, a recovering alcoholic, and a Mormon
convert—has emerged as both a unifying figure and an intellectual guide. One opinion poll, released in July by
Democracy Corps, showed that he is ""the most highly regarded individual among Tea Party supporters,"" seen not merely
as an entertainer, like Rush Limbaugh, but as an ""educator."" And in the past few months Beck has established his own
institute of learning: the online, for-profit Beck University. Enrollees can take courses like Faith 102, which contends with
""revisionists and secular progressives"" about the separation of church and state; Hope 102, an attack on the activist
federal government; and the combined Charity 101/102/103, a highly restrictive interpretation of rights, federalism, and the
division of powers.
During the ""Restoring History"" episode, Beck twice encouraged viewers to join his Web seminars, where they can hear
""lessons from the best and brightest historians and scholars that we could find."" The B.U. faculty consists of three
members, including one bona-fide academic, James R. Stoner, Jr., the chair of the political-science department at
Louisiana State University; the other two are the head of a management consulting firm and the founder of WallBuilders,
which the Web site calls ""a national pro-family organization."" Beck himself often acts as a professor, a slightly jocular one,
on his Fox News program. Surrounded by charts and figures, he offers explanations of current politics and history lessons
about the country's long march to Obama-era totalitarianism. The decline, he says, began with the Progressive era of the
early twentieth century, in particular with the Presidency of Woodrow Wilson, when both the Federal Reserve System and
the graduated federal income tax came into existence. ""Wilson,"" Beck told his radio audience in August, ""just despised
what America was.""

Beck's claims have found an audience among Tea Party spokesmen and sympathizers. At the movement's Freedom
Summit in Washington last September, one activist told a reporter, ""The election between Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow
Wilson in 1912 was when it started going downhill."" And in April an angry member of the Tea Party Patriots group from
Cape Fear, North Carolina, claimed on the group's Web site that ""the very things you see happening in this country today
started with the Wilson Administration.""
At a Tax Day rally this past spring, the veteran conservative organizer Richard Viguerie described the Tea Party as ""an
unfettered new force of the middle class."" And, indeed, calling Obama a socialist in the tradition of Woodrow Wilson is
audacious enough to seem like the marker of a new movement—or, at least, a new twist in the nation's long history of
conspiracy-mongering. In fact, it marks a revival of ideas that circulated on the extremist right half a century ago,
especially in the John Birch Society and among its admirers.
Beck's version of American history relies on lessons from his own acknowledged inspiration, the late right-wing writer W.
Cleon Skousen, and also restates charges made by the Birch Society's founder, Robert Welch. The political universe is,
of course, very different today from what it was during the Cold War. Yet the Birchers' politics and their view of American
history—which focussed more on totalitarian threats at home than on those posed by the Soviet Union and Communist
China—has proved remarkably persistent. The pressing historical question is how extremist ideas held at bay for decades
inside the Republican Party have exploded anew—and why, this time, Party leaders have done virtually nothing to
challenge those ideas, and a great deal to abet them.
The early nineteen-sixties were a turbulent time in American politics, for the right wing in particular. In the South, racist
violence against civil-rights workers was constant, deepening sectional splits in the Democratic Party that would in time
deliver the once solidly Democratic South to the Republicans. Southern elected officials, in support of what they called
""massive resistance"" to civil-rights laws and judicial rulings, resurrected the ideas of nullification and interposition, which
claimed that individual states could void federal laws within their own borders. Others focussed on what they considered a
fearsome Communist menace inside the United States. General Edwin A. Walker caused an enormous stir when he
resigned from the Army in 1961, after President John F. Kennedy's Pentagon reprimanded him for spreading right-wing
propaganda among his troops and accusing prominent American officials of Communist sympathies. Senator Strom
Thurmond, the Dixiecrat from South Carolina, spoke for many on the far right when he declared that various modestly
liberal domestic programs ""fall clearly within the category of socialism.""
The John Birch Society was one of the decade's most controversial right-wing organizations. Founded in 1958 by Robert
Welch, a candy manufacturer from Massachusetts, the society took its name from a Baptist missionary and military-
intelligence officer killed by Communist Chinese forces in 1945, whom Welch called the first American casualty of the
Cold War. The group was founded at a propitious time. After Senator Joseph McCarthy's fall, in 1954, many of McCarthy's
followers felt bereft of a voice, and Welch seemed to speak for them; by the mid-sixties, his society's membership was
estimated to be as high as a hundred thousand. Welch, exploiting fears of what McCarthy had called an ""immense""
domestic conspiracy, declared that the federal government had already fallen into the Communists' clutches. In a tract
titled ""The Politician,"" he attacked President Dwight D. Eisenhower as ""a dedicated, conscious agent of the Communist
conspiracy"" who had been serving the plot ""all of his adult life."" Late in 1961, after the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion, he
accused the Kennedy Administration of ""helping the Communists everywhere in the world while pretending to do the
opposite.""
Wherever he looked, Welch saw Communist forces manipulating American economic and foreign policy on behalf of
totalitarianism. But within the United States, he believed, the subversion had actually begun years before the Bolshevik
Revolution. Conflating modern liberalism and totalitarianism, Welch described government as ""always and inevitably an
enemy of individual freedom."" Consequently, he charged, the Progressive era, which expanded the federal government's
role in curbing social and economic ills, was a dire period in our history, and Woodrow Wilson ""more than any other one
man started this nation on its present road to totalitarianism.""
In the nineteen-sixties, Welch became convinced that even the Communist movement was but ""a tool of the total
conspiracy."" This master conspiracy, he said, had forerunners in ancient Sparta, and sprang fully to life in the eighteenth
century, in the ""uniformly Satanic creed and program"" of the Bavarian Illuminati. Run by those he called ""the Insiders,"" the
conspiracy resided chiefly in international families of financiers, such as the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers, government
agencies like the Federal Reserve System and the Internal Revenue Service, and nongovernmental organizations like the
Bilderberg Group, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Trilateral Commission. Since the early twentieth century, they
had done a good deal of their evil work under the guise of humanitarian uplift. ""One broad avenue down which these
conspiratorial forces advance was known as progressive legislation,"" Welch declared in 1966. ""The very same collectivist
theories and demagogic pretenses which had destroyed earlier civilizations were now paraded forth in the disguise of new
and modern concepts.""
In the worst case, Welch believed, military action might be necessary to dislodge the totalitarians. But for the moment a
nonviolent political revolution would suffice. Accordingly, he designed the Birch Society roughly, if not explicitly, on the
Marxist-Leninist model of a vanguard revolutionary party: a series of small cells that would work in secret to agitate the
populace and elect right-thinking candidates to office. ""It isn't numbers we have to worry about,"" Welch wrote, ""but the
courage on the part of our followers to stick their necks out and play rough—the same as the Communists do.""
The ""Founder"" himself would dictate the society's policies, advised by a council of about two dozen businessmen and
professionals, and the local cells would be overseen by unyielding commanders. ""It is the leadership that is most
demanding, most exacting of its followers,"" Welch observed, ""that achieves really dedicated support."" Welch's group

became synonymous with right-wing extremism, earning satirical blasts from critics ranging from the cartoonist Walt Kelly
to the musicians Bob Dylan and Dizzy Gillespie. The trumpeter, whose actual name was John Birks Gillespie, made a
humorous run for the Presidency in 1964, organizing John Birks Societies in twenty-five states.
Still, the most outlandish of the era's right-wing anti-Communists was not Welch but Willard Cleon Skousen. A
transplanted Canadian who served as a Mormon missionary in his teens, Skousen was considered so radical in the early
nineteen-sixties that even J. Edgar Hoover's F.B.I. watched him closely; one 1962 memo in his extensive F.B.I. file noted
that ""during the past year or so, Skousen has affiliated himself with the extreme right-wing 'professional communists' who
are promoting their own anticommunism for obvious financial purposes."" Skousen was himself employed by the F.B.I.,
from 1935 until 1951, much of that time as a special agent working chiefly in administration. These desk jobs, he claimed
implausibly, gave him access to confidential domestic intelligence about Communism. Skousen also maintained that he
had served as Hoover's administrative assistant; Hoover informed inquirers that there was no such position.
Skousen taught for years in the speech and religion departments at Brigham Young University, interrupted by a stint, from
1956 to 1960, as the police chief of Salt Lake City. His time in office was contentious, and after he raided a friendly card
game attended by the city's right-wing mayor, J. Bracken Lee, he was promptly fired. Lee called Skousen ""a master of half
truths"" and said that he ran the police department ""like a Gestapo""; Skousen's supporters placed burning crosses on the
Mayor's lawn.
After losing his police job, Skousen founded a group called the All-American Society, which Time described in 1961 as an
exemplar of the far-right ""ultras."" Although he did not join the Birch Society, Skousen worked with its American Opinion
Speakers' Bureau, and, in 1963, wrote a rousing tract titled ""The Communist Attack on the John Birch Society,"" which
condemned the society's critics for ""promoting the official Communist Party line."" (This was a tic of Skousen's; he later
defended the Mormon policy of denying the priesthood to blacks with a pamphlet called ""The Communist Attack on the
Mormons."")
All along, Skousen's evolving thoughts ran in tandem with Welch's. In ""The Naked Communist,"" a lengthy primer
published in 1958, he enlivened a survey of the worldwide leftist threat with outlandish claims, writing that F.D.R.'s adviser
Harry Hopkins had treasonously delivered to the Soviets a large supply of uranium, and that the Russians built the first
Sputnik with plans stolen from the United States. A year before Richard Condon's novel ""The Manchurian Candidate""
appeared, Skousen announced that the Communists were creating ""a regimented breed of Pavlovian men whose minds
could be triggered into immediate action by signals from their masters."" A later book, ""The Naked Capitalist,"" decried the
Ivy League Establishment, who, through the Federal Reserve, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Rockefeller
Foundation, formed ""the world's secret power structure."" The conspiracy had begun, Skousen wrote, when reformers like
the wealthy banker Edward M. (Colonel) House, a close adviser to President Woodrow Wilson, helped put into place the
Federal Reserve and the graduated income tax.
In 1971, Skousen organized another group, the Freemen Institute, which he later renamed the National Center for
Constitutional Studies. According to an article published in the Review of Religious Research, the center's targets
included ""the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal
Communication Commission's fairness doctrine in editorial broadcasting, the federal government's change of the gold
standard in currency, all subsidies to farmers, all federal aid to education, all federal social welfare, foreign aid, social
security, elimination of public school prayer and Bible reading, and (that familiar right-wing nemesis) the United Nations.""
Skousen's pronouncements made him a pariah among most conservative activists, including some on the right-wing
fringe. In 1962, the ultraconservative American Security Council threw him out, because members felt that he had ""gone
off the deep end."" In 1971, a review in the Mormon journal Dialogue accused Skousen of ""inventing fantastic ideas and
making inferences that go far beyond the bounds of honest commentary,"" and advancing doctrines that came ""perilously
close"" to Nazism. And in 1979, after Skousen called President.Jimmy Carter a puppet of the Council on Foreign Relations
and the Rockefeller family, the president of the Mormon church issued a national order banning announcements about his
organizations.
Skousen was undeterred. In 1981, he produced ""The 5,000 Year Leap,"" a treatise that assembles selective quotations
and groundless assertions to claim that the U.S. Constitution is rooted not in the Enlightenment but in the Bible, and that
the framers believed in minimal central government. Either proposition would have astounded James Madison, often
described as the guiding spirit behind the Constitution, who rejected state-established religions and, like Alexander
Hamilton, proposed a central government so strong that it could veto state laws. ""The 5,000 Year Leap"" is not a fervid
book. Instead, it is calmly, ingratiatingly misleading. Skousen quotes various eighteenth-century patriots on the evils of
what Samuel Adams, in 1768, called ""the Utopian schemes of leveling,"" which Skousen equates with redistribution of
wealth. But he does not mention the Founders' endorsement of taxing the rich to support the general welfare. Thomas
Jefferson, for example, wrote approvingly in 1811 of having federal taxes (then limited to tariffs) fall solely on the wealthy,
which meant that ""the farmer will see his government supported, his children educated, and the face of his country made
a paradise by the contributions of the rich alone, without his being called on to spend a cent from his earnings.""
Skousen also challenges the separation of church and state, asserting that ""the Founders were not indulging in any idle
gesture when they adopted the motto 'In God We Trust.' ""In reality, the motto that came out of the Constitutional
Convention was ""E Pluribus Unum"": out of many, one. ""In God We Trust"" came much later; its use on coins was first
permitted in 1864, and only in 1955, at the height of the Cold War, did Congress mandate that it appear on all currency.
The following year, President Eisenhower—who Welch charged was a Communist agent—approved ""In God We Trust"" as
the national motto.

In 1982, Skousen published a follow-up work, an ancestor-worshipping history text titled The Making of America,"" and
prepared a study guide for nationwide seminars based on its contents. As Alexander Zaitchik reports in his informative
study of Beck, ""Common Nonsense,"" the new book became an object of controversy in 1987, after the California
Bicentennial Commission sold it as part of a fund-raising drive. Among its offenses was an account of slavery drawn from
long-disgraced work by the historian Fred A. Shannon, which characterized slave children as ""pickaninnies"" and
suggested that the worst victims of slavery were the slaveholders themselves. The constitutional scholar Jack Rakove, of
Stanford, inspected Skousen's book and seminars and pronounced them ""a joke that no self-respecting scholar would
think is worth a warm pitcher of spit.""
By the time Skousen died, in 2006, he was little remembered outside the ranks of the furthest-right Mormons. Then, in
2009, Glenn Beck began touting his work: ""The Naked Communist,"" ""The Naked Capitalist,"" and, especially, ""The 5,000
Year Leap,"" which he called ""essential to understanding why our Founders built this Republic the way they did."" After
Beck put the book in the first spot on his required-reading list—and wrote an enthusiastic new introduction for its reissue—
it shot to the top of the Amazon best-seller list. In the first half of 2009, it sold more than two hundred and fifty thousand
copies. Local branches of the Tea Party Patriots, the United American Tea Party, and other groups across the country
have since organized study groups around it. ""It is time we learn and follow the FREEDOM principles of our Founding
Fathers,"" a United American Tea Party video declares, referring to the principles expounded by Skousen's book. If Beck is
the movement's teacher, ""The 5,000 Year Leap"" has become its primer, with ""The Making of America"" as a kind of 102-
level text.
The popularity of Beck's broadcasts, which now reach two million viewers each day, has brought neo-Birchite ideas to an
audience beyond any that Welch or Skousen might have dreamed of. Several times a week, Beck informs his audience
that socialists (whom he also sometimes calls Fascists or Communists) led by Obama have seized power, and that
patriotic Americans must take their country back. His TV show for some time featured ""Comrade Updates,"" in which Beck
described perfidy while the Soviet anthem played in the background. He attacks all the familiar bogeymen: the Federal
Reserve System (which he asserts is a private conglomerate, unaccountable to the public); the Council on Foreign
Relations (born of a ""progressive idea"" to manipulate the media in order to ""let the masses know what should be done"");
and a historical procession of evildoers, including Skousen's old target Colonel House and Welch's old target Woodrow
Wilson. His sources on these matters, quite apart from Skousen's books, can be unreliable. On September 22nd, amid a
diatribe about House, Beck cited a passage from ""Secrets of the Federal Reserve,"" by Eustace Mullins. The book,
commissioned in 1948 by Ezra Pound, is a startlingly anti-Semitic fantasy of how a Jewish-led conspiracy of all-powerful
bankers established the Federal Reserve in service of their plot to dominate the world.
Part of Beck's allure is the promise that he will reveal secret information. In one segment last year, he produced a drawing
of fasces—which he described, anachronistically, as ""the Roman symbol of Fascism""—and then a picture of an old
Mercury dime, with fasces on the reverse side. ""Who brought this dime in? It happened in 1916—Woodrow Wilson was
the President,"" he said. ""We've been on the road to Fascism for a while."" Benito Mussolini, of course, didn't adopt the
ancient symbol of authority as the Fascist emblem until the nineteen-twenties; the designer of the coin, the sculptor
Adolph A. Weinman, intended it to signify the nation's military preparedness, and paired it with an olive branch to illustrate
the desire for peace.
Beck's readings of Progressive-era politics are nearly as bizarre. Whatever can be said about Theodore Roosevelt, he
was not a crypto-radical. It was Roosevelt who coined the term ""lunatic fringe"" to describe the extreme leftists of his day,
and his concept of New Nationalism—in which an activist government built a vibrant capitalism, partly by regulating big
business—looked back to Alexander Hamilton, not Karl Marx. Nor was Wilson a Bolshevik; in fact, in 1917 he sent
American troops to Russia to support the anti-Bolshevik White Army. At home, his reforms sought to break up monopolies
in order to restore competition among small companies. ""If America is not to have free enterprise,"" Wilson declared, ""then
she can have no freedom of any sort whatever.""
In 2007, Beck, then the host of ""Glenn Beck,"" on CNN's Headline News, brought to his show a John Birch Society
spokesman named Sam Antonio, who warned of a government plot to abolish U.S. borders with Mexico and Canada,
""and eventually all throughout the Americas."" Beck told Antonio, ""When I was growing up, the John Birch Society—I
thought they were a bunch of nuts."" But now, he said, ""you guys are starting to make more and more sense to me."" His
guest beamed. ""Yes, we at the John Birch Society are not nuts,"" Antonio said. ""We are just exposing the truth that's been
out there for many, many years."" Since then, the Birch Society's Web site has run clips from Beck's Fox broadcasts,
proudly pointing out similarities with their own ideas. Last June, an essay on the site described a presentation by Beck on
Communism in America as ""the ultimate in complete agreement between the Beck and JBS presentations of American
history.""
Beck has also praised Ezra Taft Benson, one of Skousen's close associates. Benson, the Secretary of Agriculture under
President Eisenhower and the thirteenth president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, gained notoriety for
a speech in 1966 in which he denounced Democratic officeholders and intellectuals (including the historian Arthur M.
Schlesinger, Jr.) as socialists and Communist sympathizers, warned that ""the Constitution will be endangered and hang,
as it were, by a single thread,"" and praised the John Birch Society as ""the most effective non-church organization in our
fight against creeping socialism and Godless Communism."" Last June, Beck aired a clip from another Benson speech,
intoning, ""Ezra Taft Benson warned about what was coming."" The Birch Society's Web site subsequently praised Beck for
""getting progressively (sorry for the bad word choice) closer to presenting American history in the way that The John Birch
Society has been doing it for over 50 years.""

Beck is no more the sole representative of today's multifaceted Tea Party than Welch or Skousen was of the nineteen-
sixties far right; he recently told the Times, a bit disingenuously, that he was ""not involved with the Tea Party."" Why, then,
have the politics of Skousen, Benson, and the John Birch Society had such a resurgence among conservative
Republicans—not just through Beck but through Tea Party heroes like the Nevada Republican Senate candidate Sharron
Angle? (Last month, Angle gave a warm address to a ""freedom conference"" in Salt Lake City, co-sponsored by the John
Birch Society and Skousen's old group, the National Center for Constitutional Studies, praising her audience as
""mainstream America"" and patriots who had ""heard the call."") The columnist Frank Rich, among others, has suggested
that the election of a black President sowed ""fears of disenfranchisement among a dwindling and threatened minority in
the country."" There are signs that this is so: Republicans' singling out of Thurgood Marshall as an ""activist Justice"" during
Elena Kagan's Supreme Court confirmation hearings, the warnings on Fox News about the terrible dangers posed by the
minuscule New Black Panther Party. But ""socialist"" is not a racial slur. Jim Crow was not built out of fears of the Federal
Reserve and the I.R.S. The Tea Party's fulminations against cap-and-trade, federal-government bailouts, and big
government generally play on very old themes that have nothing to do with the color of President Obama's skin.
The current right-wing resurgence has more to do with the inner dynamics of American conservatism in the past half
century. In the nineteen-fifties and nineteen-sixties, the far right was condemned by liberals, as might be expected; in
November, 1961, President Kennedy devoted part of a speech in Los Angeles to denouncing those ""discordant voices of
extremism"" that ""equate the Democratic Party with the welfare state, the welfare state with socialism, and socialism with
Communism."" But the Bircher right also provoked deep anxiety among conservatives, who feared being perceived as
paranoids and conspiracy-mongers.
The leading intellectual spokesman and organizer of the anti-Bircher conservatives was William F. Buckley, Jr., the editor
of National Review. Buckley was by no means moderate in his conservatism. He was a lifelong defender of Joseph
McCarthy and a foe of New Deal liberalism. But he drew the line at claiming that the course of American government was
set by a socialist conspiracy, and he feared that the ravings of the extreme right would cost more balanced, practical
conservatives their chance at national power. ""By 1961,"" his biographer John B. Judis writes, ""Buckley was beginning to
worry that with the John Birch Society growing so rapidly, the right-wing upsurge in the country would take an ugly, even
Fascist turn rather than leading toward the kind of conservatism National Review had promoted."" In the next two decades,
with Buckley's support and counsel, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan completed a conservative revolution that
succeeded by keeping extremist elements far from the centers of power.
As confidant and adviser to leading conservative politicians, Buckley had far more political influence than might be
expected from the editor of a weekly journal. Yet in the early nineteen-sixties he found fighting the Birchers and their
fellow-travellers extremely difficult. Even though some of Buckley's colleagues at National Review thought that the Birch
Society went too far, they would not attack the society publicly, for fear of alienating both the Birchers and the
conservatives who sympathized with their views. When Buckley wrote an editorial in 1962 that accused Welch of
""distorting reality"" and failing to make ""the crucial moral and political distinction"" between Communists and liberals, the
magazine immediately lost subscriptions and financial support.
By 1960, Senator Barry Goldwater, of Arizona, was emerging as the great political hope of conservative Republicans, and
he consulted closely with Buckley. At a meeting at the Breakers hotel, in Palm Beach, in January, 1962, Buckley urged
Goldwater to repudiate the Birch Society. Goldwater demurred; though he conceded that some embarrassing ""kooks""
lurked among the Birchers, he insisted to Buckley that there were also some ""nice guys,"" and that it would be injudicious
to attack the group in public. The Birchers' support helped gain Goldwater the Republican Presidential nomination in
1964, and he winked at them in his acceptance speech with his famous line: ""Extremism in the defense of liberty is no
vice. . . . Moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.""
In the general election, though, Goldwater suffered a crushing loss to Lyndon Johnson, partly because Democrats
succeeded in making him look like a captive of the loony right. (To the Goldwater slogan ""In Your Heart, You Know He's
Right,"" the Democrats shot back, ""In Your Guts, You Know He's Nuts."") Buckley's fears had been confirmed. But he was
undeterred in his efforts to build a respectable and viable conservative movement. In 1967, he favored Richard Nixon
among a field of Republican aspirants. He liked Ronald Reagan's politics, but considered Reagan, who had only recently
been elected the governor of California, too new to national politics. George Romney, the governor of Michigan, a wishy-
washy moderate, was obviously unsuitable, to say nothing of the Republican archliberal Nelson Rockefeller, of New York.
Nixon was a hard-nosed Republican with strong conservative views, especially on Communism and the Cold War; he had
established himself as a Communist-hunter in the nineteen-forties by pressing the charge that Alger Hiss, a former official
at the State Department, had spied for the Soviets. And, promisingly, Nixon was the front-runner. ""It seems to me that we
ought to have a real chance of winning this year,"" Buckley wrote to Goldwater around the time of the Republican National
Convention. He served the campaign as an adviser, and by aiding his friend Frank Shakespeare, who had taken charge
of Nixon's media operations.
But Buckley's candidate had a reputation for shiftiness that made him unpopular across the political spectrum. Some of
the editors of National Review, recalling that Nixon had cut a deal with Rockefeller in order to secure the G.O.P.
nomination in 1960, didn't sufficiently trust him. And the Birch Society had nothing but contempt for the figure whom
Welch had called one of ""the slipperiest politicians that ever showed up on the American scene."" As President, in 1969,
Nixon began to open diplomatic relations with Communist China, and the right wing placed him on its list of perfidious
appeasers. When he visited Beijing in 1972, even Buckley was deeply offended. But when the general election took place
later that year, with the antiwar Democratic candidate, George McGovern, voicing the country's anxieties over Vietnam,

Buckley and the mainstream of what he called ""responsible conservatism"" returned to Nixon. The purist conservatives
were left to back the third-party candidacy of John Schmitz, a Republican congressman and a member of the John Birch
Society.
Nixon won in a landslide, and the next year he appointed Buckley the American delegate to the United Nations. The
conservative pragmatists had found the way to real power. And, despite the embarrassment of Watergate, in Nixon's
second term, their strategy proved effective over time. Nixon's campaign against McGovern sharpened the Democrats'
internal divisions over civil rights and Vietnam, and, Buckley wrote, revealed that the Democrats had ""an indifference
toward national independence and a hostility toward national freedom."" Meanwhile, the Buckley mainstream, having read
the Birchers out of the conservative movement, established itself as a permanent and growing force in t"						
e Republican							
Party and in national politics.							
In 1976	 Buckley and National Review supported Ronald Reagan's primary challenge to Nixon's successor	 Gerald Ford.					
After two terms as governor	 Reagan had matured into what Buckley considered a nearly ideal conservative politician: a						
shrewd leader as well as a man of principle. Reagan nearly succeeded in wresting the nomination from Ford							
demonstrating how formidable a national figure he had become. The Bircher right had flourished in his political bastion of							
Orange County	 and Reagan was adept at winning extremists' allegiance while he pursued realistic strategies. His						
pragmatic side showed immediately after he finally secured the Republican nomination in 1980	 when he chose the						
relatively moderate George H. W. Bush	 his bitter foe during the primaries	 as his running mate. Though the decision					
dismayed right-wing ideologues	 it had two practical benefits: it instantly healed the divisions between Republican						
moderates and conservatives	 and it helped dampen charges from the Democrats that Reagan was a reckless right-						
winger. Nobody was more pleased by Bush's selection than his fellow Skull and Bones man William F. Buckley	 who						
understood the political logic as clearly as Reagan had.							
As President	 Reagan flattered the extremists—he even delivered some admiring words about Skousen's Freemen						
Institute—but he saved his political capital for his real goals: undoing the fiscal underpinnings of New Deal-style							
government	 and redirecting U.S. foreign policy by battling the Soviet Union and its proxies around the world. He						
appointed moderates to positions of importance	 as when he made James Baker III	 Bush's close associate	 his first chief				
of staff	 rather than the far more ideological Edwin Meese III	 his former chief of staff from California. (As a top policy					
adviser	 Meese helped Reagan stack the federal bench with conservatives	 but he was otherwise eclipsed by Baker and					
Baker's deputy	 the pragmatic Reaganite Michael Deaver	 and his crusade	 as Attorney General	 to roll back civil-rights			
legislation largely failed.) When zealots in the Administration were exposed	 as in the Iran-Contra scandal	 Reagan					
skillfully evaded responsibility and replaced them with more centrist Republicans. And	 when he recognized in Mikhail						
Gorbachev a Soviet leader with whom he could undertake genuine efforts to reduce the nuclear threat	 Reagan pushed						
forward	 ignoring the complaints that he had become	 in the hard-liner Howard Phillips's phrase	 ""a useful idiot for Soviet				
propaganda.""							
Whatever misgivings may have arisen about him on the right	 Reagan achieved a dramatic conservative overhaul of the						
federal tax code	 a profound reconfiguring of the judiciary	 and a near-victory for the West in the Cold War. From the					
standpoint of the mainstream right	 the only problem with his legacy was that no other Republican could come close to						
matching his public appeal and political savvy. For the party of Reagan	 his departure was the beginning of a long decline						
and it is the absence of a similarly totemic figure	 during the past twenty years	 that has allowed the current resurgence of					
extremism. George H. W. Bush repelled right-wingers with his moderate tendencies—not least when	 in the face of fiscal						
calamity	 he broke his campaign pledge not to raise taxes. Bill Clinton inspired them to an almost ecstatic series of						
attacks	 and though there remained enough of an older conservative establishment	 personified by Senator Bob Dole	 to				
check some of the wildest charges	 the new Republican House majority after 1994	 pushed by such ideologues as Tom					
DeLay and Dick Armey	 had little interest in maintaining the center. They harassed Clinton	 forcing an impeachment even					
though polls showed that more than sixty per cent of the American people disapproved. George W. Bush seemed at first							
to have a bit of Reagan's conservative charisma	 but the right wing turned against him for failing to win the war in Iraq	 for					
his moderate position on immigration	 and for spending hundreds of millions of federal dollars to combat the financial						
collapse in 2008. When William F. Buckley died	 during the 2008 primary season	 it seemed to symbolize the end of a					
conservative era. David Klinghoffer	 a former literary editor at National Review	 lamented that ""urbane visionaries and					
builders of institutions"" such as Buckley have been replaced by media figures ""who make their money by stirring fears and							
resentments."" Conservatism	 Klinghoffer added	 ""has undergone a shift toward demagoguery and hucksterism	 and is				
now ruled by those he called ""the crazy-cons.""							
Some Republicans have tried to extend the Buckley tradition	 but to little effect. The commentator David Frum	 a former					
speechwriter for George W. Bush	 lost his job at the American Enterprise Institute after he complained about the						
Republicans' obstruction of health-care reform and called the right-wing surge a threat to conservatism. In June	 the						
congressman Bob Inglis	 of South Carolina	 a tough conservative who nonetheless backed Bush's financial bailout	 lost a				
vicious primary fight with a right-wing insurgent named Trey Gowdy. To his amazement	 Inglis was confronted on the						
campaign trail by voters who were convinced that numbers on their Social Security cards indicated that a secret bank had							
bought them at birth. ""And then	 of course	 he recalls	 ""it turned into something about the Federal Reserve and the				
Bilderbergers and all that stuff."" Not even Karl Rove can afford open dissent with the Tea Partiers. Appearing on Fox							
News the night of the recent primaries	 he described the Tea Party-backed Senate candidate in Delaware	 Christine					
O'Donnell	 as probably unelectable and said that some of her statements were ""nutty."" Instantly	 criticism came from					
Sarah Palin	 Rush Limbaugh	 and other right-wing Republicans. Within days	 he was back on Fox	 proclaiming himself ""a

huge Tea Party fan	 endorsing O'Donnell	 and affirming that the National Republican Senatorial Committee would give					
her its full backing.							
So far	 Rove	 an unlikely dissident	 is the only prominent Republican leader to so much as gesture at stepping forward	 as			
Buckley and his allies did. Even strong conservatives like Inglis have been pushed aside	 as have such former G.O.P.						
stalwarts as Charlie Crist	 in Florida	 and Mike Castle	 in Delaware	 both beaten in the primaries by Tea Party candidates;			
Grist is now running a long-shot campaign as an Independent. Desperate for gains in the midterm elections	 the						
Republicans are neglecting the struggle it took to make politics safe for Reagan.							
Fifty years ago	 President Kennedy deplored the far right's ""counsels of fear and suspicion."" Today	 Obama's White					
House is still struggling to make sense of its enemies. In the absence of forthright leadership	 on both the right and the						
left	 the job of standing up to extremists appears to have been left to the electorate. Candidates like O'Donnell may prove						
too eccentric to prevail	 or voters may simply become disillusioned by politicians who campaign on their hatred of						
government. After the election	 mainstream conservatives may well engage in what Richard Viguerie has forecast as ""a						
massive	 almost historic battle for the heart and soul of the Republican Party."" (Already	 Rove and some leading Bush					
political operatives	 including the former Republican National Committee chairman Ed Gillespie	 have been quietly					
supplanting the battered G.O.P. establishment in the effort to raise funds for this year's candidates.) But	 according to a						
recent poll	 more than seventy per cent of Republicans support the Tea Party	 and it seems almost certain that a					
Republican Party that has unstintingly appeased the far right will enjoy a strong and perhaps smashing victory in the							
coming midterm elections.							
In 1906	 early in the Progressive era	 the humorist Finley Peter Dunne's fictional barroom sage	 Mr. Dooley	 put the social			
and political tumult of the day into perspective. ""Th' noise ye hear is not th' first gun iv a revolution	 Dooley remarked. ""It's						
on'y th' people iv th' United States batin' a carpet."" A century from now	 or even a year from now	 Americans may say the					
same about the Tea Party. For the moment	 though	 it appears that the extreme right wing is on the verge of securing a					
degree of power over Congress and the Republican Party that is unprecedented in modern American history. For							
defenders of national cohesion and tempered adversity in our politics	 it is an alarming state of affairs. •

Bringing Up Boehner <http://www.huffingtonpost.com/drew-westen/post 1034 b 755497.html>							
According to news reports	 today Republican minority leader and Coppertone model						
John Boehner will give his ""closing argument"" to the American people on why they							
should throw out the Democrats and kill the Obama-Pelosi-Reid ""job-killing							
agenda."" He will be returning to his working class roots	 speaking at a piping						
manufacturing plant	 an unusual venue these days for a man who is seen much more						
frequently at gatherings of Wall Street executives with open checkbooks and the							
males-only country club where he works on his tan when not making the rounds at							
other clubs with industry lobbyists.							
Either the Speaker-to-be is following the model of Michael Steele and							
free-lancing	 or Karl Rove and the Republicans believe it is safe or even						
advantageous to bring him out in public after the White House made an effort to							
put Boehner's face on what a Republican majority might look like	 with the						
president invoking his name eight times in one speech.							
I have to admit that at the time I was agnostic as to whether it made sense to							
try to brand him at this late date	 as Boehner has minimal name recognition						
among voters. But the White House was no doubt responding to three realities.							
First	 Boehner is an unknown to most Americans	 which means that	 unlike most				
Republicans in the news	 he has not been well branded by the GOP -- which means						
for once Democrats might actually brand someone or something first rather than							
playing catch-up. Second	 Boehner would indeed be the highest-ranking Republican						
were the GOP to assume control over the House (other than of course Karl Rove							
who is now directing traffic on the right side of the street in Washington							
again). And third	 a concrete face is always better than an abstraction when						
telling a story	 and other than perhaps Sarah Palin	 who Republicans could					
alternately accept and decline as the leader of their party	 Boehner's tanned						
visage and history as errand-boy for virtually every major corporate special							
interest in his two decades in Washington (including his stint as the Marlboro							
Man	 handing out tobacco lobby campaign checks to his fellow Republicans on the						
floor of the House) made him a potential counter-villain to the Republican's							
bogeywoman	 Nancy Pelosi.						
I remained agnostic until this week	 when colleagues at Media Matters Action						
Network and I conducted a national messaging survey							
<http://cloudfront.mediamattersaction.org/static/images/pdf/BrandingBoehner.pdf>							
with 1	000 registered voters	 selected to match the demographics of the voting					
and likely voting populations. The goal was to see how effectively we could							
speak with voters about Boehner as not only the symbol and standard-bearer for							
the GOP but also the water-boy for corporate America. (The results were							
surprisingly similar whether we looked at registered voters or likely voters							
although as others have described	 precisely how to determine who is a ""likely						
voter"" in this election is as much art as science	 and the point of good						
messaging at this point is actually to change the dynamics of likely voting	 not						
just to reflect them.)							
As detailed in a memo published in Politico	 what we found was clear: Boehner is						
a target well worth defining	 who readily stands for precisely what Americans						
perceive to be the reasons they would have to hold their noses to vote for							
Congressional Republicans (perhaps the only group left who poll worse than							
Congressional Democrats with swing voters). We tested both paragraph-length							
narratives and single-sentence language designed to capture the essence of those							
narratives	 and in each case	 we tested them against the toughest opposition					
language we could test them against: the words of Boehner	 Cantor	 Limbaugh and					
others combined in defining the ""Obama-Pelosi-Reid"" agenda.							
What we found	 in brief	 is that we could beat a tough GOP narrative about the					
job-killing"" socialists in the White House and Congress by 15 to 20 points with							
two narratives starring Boehner in the leading role (with best supporting bad

actor going in one of the narratives to Karl Rove and his corporate allies)	 and						
we could win with over 15 different sentence-long descriptions of ""what's the							
matter with Boehner"" with margins ranging from 10 to 60 points against a tough							
conservative attack on the Obama-Pelosi-Reid axis of conservative evil.							
The narratives that most moved likely voters -- including swing voters	 who						
preferred them by double-digits over tough Republican rhetoric -- made clear							
whose voices Boehner would be speaking for as Speaker (e.g.	 the Wall Street						
executives he convened to try to block Wall Street reform). They harnessed the							
same populist anger at the hijacking of Washington by corporate special							
interests that has enlivened the tea partiers and is palpable across the							
political spectrum	 and they focused on the extremism of the party Boehner would						
Speak for. A narrative that brought Karl Rove into the picture was slightly more							
polarizing with swing voters but slightly more powerful with likely Democratic							
voters.							
In some ways what was most surprising was the success of the single-line							
statements of what we need in a Speaker and who John Boehner really speaks for							
(although these single-line statements came after the narratives	 and likely						
reflect the power of branding	 even over the course of a brief online encounter						
with voters). They ranged from relatively lofty and aspirational (e.g.	 ""We need						
a Speaker who is also a listener	 who can hear the voices of ordinary Americans""						
#NAME?							
in message testing on the role of money in politics) -- to the harder-edged							
(e.g.	 ""The Speaker of the House is a heartbeat away from the Presidency.						
Unfortunately	 we know where John Boehner's heart is	 and it isn't with the					
middle class	 or ""John Boehner understands deficits. He's spent nearly 20 years						
in Washington creating them."")							
If there's a message in this message research	 it is at once short-term and						
long-term. In the short run	 if Democrats want to hang onto their seats in						
November	 they would do well to define this election in terms of the middle						
class and small business versus the billionaires and big corporations that are							
hijacking our democracy; to use Boehner as a poster child for the party whose							
primary commitment is to the latter and whose tan is a testament to that							
commitment; and to avoid giving voters reason to regret their vote if they give							
it to Democrats again this time	 by supporting the things they say they stand						
for and avoiding that golden mean between the public interest and the special							
interests that finance campaigns on both sides of the aisle.							
In the longer run	 branding matters. One of the biggest strategic and messaging						
mistakes of the last two years was the failure of Democrats to brand their							
opponents while their opponents were busy branding them -- and in particular the							
failure to brand the Bush Recession as the natural consequence of failed							
Republican economic principles. Two years ago	 that was a virtually uncontested						
political proposition	 as the voters made clear in handing Democrats the White						
House and supermajorities in both the House and Senate. Today	 the public is						
split down the middle as to who caused the recession.							
Reality doesn't brand itself. Hopefully it won't take a. debacle in November and							
another 10 million jobs lost for reality to unveil itself again for a brief							
political moment and for progressives to have a second bite at the apple.

Even when there was no ""peace process	 the possibility of resurrecting one						
provided hope to the gullible	 cover to the guileful	 beguilement for the press	 an				
excuse for doing nothing to those gaining from the status quo	 and - last but far from						
least - lifetime employment for career ""peace processors."" The perpetual processing							
of peace without the requirement to produce it has been especially appreciated by							
Israeli leaders. It has enabled them to behave like magicians	 riveting foreign attention						
on meaningless distractions as they systematically removed Palestinians from their							
homes	 settled half a million or more Jews in newly vacated areas of the occupied						
territories	 and annexed a widening swath of land to a Jerusalem they insist belongs						
only to Israel.							
Palestinian leaders with legitimacy problems have also had reason to collaborate							
in the search for a ""peace process."" It's not just that there has been no obviously							
better way to end their people's suffering. Playing ""peace process"" charades justifies							
the international patronage and Israeli backing these leaders need to retain their status							
in the occupied territories. It ensures that they have media access and high-level							
visiting rights in Washington. Meanwhile	 for American leaders	 engagement in some					
sort of Middle East ""peace process"" has been essential to credibility in the Arab and							
Islamic worlds	 as well as with the ever-generous American Jewish community. Polls						
show that most American Jews are impatient for peace. Despite all the evidence to							
the contrary	 they are eager to believe in the willingness of the government of Israel to						
trade land for it.							
Previous ""peace processes"" have exploited all these impulses. In practice							
however	 these diplomatic distractions have served to obscure Israeli actions and						
evasions that were more often prejudicial to peace than helpful in achieving it.							
Behind all the blather	 the rumble of bulldozers has never stopped. Given this						
history	 it has taken a year and a half of relentless effort by U.S. Special Envoy George						
Mitchell to persuade the parties even to meet directly to talk about talks as they first							
did here in Oslo	 seventeen years ago. When the curtain goes up on the diplomatic						
show in Washington tomorrow	 will the players put on a different skit? There are						
many reasons to doubt that they will.							
One is that the Obama administration has engaged the same aging impresarios							
who staged all the previously failed ""peace processes"" to produce and direct this one							
with no agreed script. The last time these guys staged such an ill-prepared meeting	 at						
Camp David in 2000	 it cost both heads of delegation	 Ehud Barak and Yasser Arafat					
their political authority. It led not to peace but to escalating violence. The parties are							
showing up this time to minimize President Obama's political embarrassment in							
advance of midterm elections in the United States	 not to address his agenda - still less						
to address each other's agendas. These are indeed difficulties. But the problems with

this latest - and possibly final - iteration of the perpetually ineffectual ""peace process""							
are more fundamental.							
The Likud Party charter flatly rejects the establishment of a Palestinian Arab							
state west of the Jordan River and stipulates that: ""The Palestinians can run their lives							
freely in the framework of self-rule	 but not as an independent and sovereign state.""						
This Israeli government is committed to that charter as well as to the Jewish holy war							
for land in Palestine. It has no interest in trading land it covets for a peace that might							
thwart further territorial expansion. It considers itself unbound by the applicable UN							
resolutions	 agreements from past peace talks	 the ""Roadmap	 or the premise of the				
two-state solution.""							
The Palestinians are desperate for the dignity and security that only the end of							
the Israeli occupation can provide. But the authority of Palestinian negotiators to							
negotiate rests on their recognition by Israel and the United States	 not on their						
standing in the occupied territories	 Gaza	 or the Palestinian diaspora. Fatah is the					
ruling faction in part of Palestine. Its authority to govern was repudiated by voters in							
the last Palestinian elections. The Mahmoud Abbas administration retains power by							
grace of the Israeli occupation authorities and the United States	 which prefer it to the						
government empowered by the Palestinian people at the polls. Mr. Abbas's							
constitutional term of office has long since expired. He presides over a parliament							
whose most influential members are locked up in Israeli jails. It is not clear for							
whom he	 his faction	 or his administration can now speak.					
So the talks that begin tomorrow promise to be a case of the uninterested going							
through the motions of negotiating with the mandate-less. The parties to these talks							
seek to mollify an America that has severely lessened international credibility. The							
United States government had to borrow the modest reputations for objectivity of							
others - the EU	 Russia	 and the UN - to be able to convene this discussion. It will be					
held under the auspices of an American president who was publicly humiliated by							
Israel's prime minister on the issue that is at the center of the Israel-Palestine dispute -							
Israel's continuing seizure and colonization of Arab land.							
Vague promises of a Palestinian state within a year now waft through the air.							
But the ""peace process"" has always sneered at deadlines	 even much	 much firmer					
ones. A more definitive promise of an independent Palestine within a year was made							
at Annapolis three years ago. Analogous promises of Palestinian self-determination							
have preceded or resulted from previous meetings over the decades	 beginning with						
the Camp David accords of 1979. Many in this audience will recall the five-year							
deadline fixed at Oslo. The talks about talks that begin tomorrow can yield concrete							
results only if the international community is prepared this time to insist on the one-

year deadline put forward for recognizing a Palestinian state. Even then there will be							
no peace unless long-neglected issues are addressed.							
Peace is a pattern of stability acceptable to those with the capacity to disturb it							
by violence. It is almost impossible to impose. It cannot become a reality	 still less be						
sustained	 if those who must accept it are excluded from it. This reality directs our						
attention to who is not at this gathering in Washington and what must be done to							
remedy the problems these absences create.							
Obviously	 the party that won the democratically expressed mandate of the						
Palestinian people to represent them - Hamas - is not there. Yet there can be no							
peace without its buy-in. Egypt and Jordan have been invited as observers. Yet they							
have nothing to add to the separate peace agreements each long ago made with Israel.							
(Both these agreements were explicitly premised on grudging Israeli undertakings to							
accept Palestinian self-determination. The Jewish state quickly finessed both.)							
Activists from the Jewish diaspora disproportionately staff the American delegation.							
A failure to reconcile either American Jews or the Palestine diaspora to peace would							
doom any accord. But the Palestinian diaspora will be represented in Washington							
only in tenuous theory	 not in fact.						
Other Arabs	 including the Arab League and the author of its peace initiative						
Saudi Arabia	 will not be at the talks tomorrow. The reasons for this are both simple						
and complex. At one level they reflect both a conviction that this latest installment of							
the ""peace process"" is just another in a long series of public entertainments for the							
American electorate and also a lack of confidence in the authenticity of the Palestinian							
delegation. At another level	 they result from the way the United States has defined						
the problems to be solved and the indifference to Arab interests and views this							
definition evidences. Then too	 they reflect disconnects in political culture and						
negotiating style between Israelis	 Arabs	 and Americans.					
To begin with	 neither Israel nor the conveners of this proposed new ""peace						
process"" have officially acknowledged or responded to the Arab peace initiative of							
2002. This offered normalization of relations with the Jewish state	 should Israel						
make peace with the Palestinians. Instead	 the United States and the Quartet have						
seemed to pocket the Arab offer	 ignore its precondition that Israelis come to terms						
with Palestinians	 and gone on to levy new demands.						
In this connection	 making Arab recognition of Israel's ""right to exist"" the						
central purpose of the ""peace process"" offends Arabs on many levels. In framing the							
issue this way	 Israel and the United States appear to be asking for something well						
beyond pragmatic accommodation of the reality of a Jewish state in the Middle East.

To the Arabs	 Americans now seem to be insisting on Arab endorsement of the idea						
of the state of Israel	 the means by which that state was established	 and the manner in					
which it has comported itself. Must Arabs really embrace Zionism before Israel can							
cease expansion and accept peace?							
Arabs and Muslims familiar with European history can accept that European							
anti-Semitism justified the establishment of a homeland for traumatized European							
Jews. But asking them even implicitly to agree that the forcible eviction of Palestinian							
Arabs was a morally appropriate means to this end is both a nonstarter and seriously							
off-putting. So is asking them to affirm that resistance to such displacement was and							
is sinful. Similarly	 the Arabs see the demand that they recognize a Jewish state with						
no fixed borders as a clever attempt to extract their endorsement of Israel's unilateral							
expansion at Palestinian expense.							
The lack of appeal in this approach has been compounded by a longstanding							
American habit of treating Arab concerns about Israel as a form of anti-Semitism and							
tuning them out. Instead of hearing out and addressing Arab views	 U.S. peace						
processors have repeatedly focused on soliciting Arab acts of kindness toward Israel.							
They argue that gestures of acceptance can help Israelis overcome their Holocaust-							
inspired political neuroses and take risks for peace.							
Each time this notion of Arab diplomacy as psychotherapy for Israelis has-							
been trotted out	 it has been met with incredulity. To most in the region	 it					
encapsulates the contrast between Washington's sympathy and solicitude for Israelis							
and its condescendingly exploitative view of Arabs. Some see it as a barely disguised							
appeal for a policy of appeasement of Israel. Still others suspect an attempt to							
construct a ""peace process"" in which Arabs begin to supply Israel with gifts of carrots							
so that Americans can continue to avoid applying sticks to it.							
The effort to encourage Arab generosity as an offset to American political							
pusillanimity vis-à-vis Israel is ludicrously unpersuasive. It has failed so many times							
that it should be obvious that it will not work. Yet it was a central element of George							
Mitchell's mandate for ""peace process"" diplomacy. And it appears to have resurfaced							
as part of the proposed follow-up to tomorrow's meeting between the parties in							
Washington. It should be no puzzle why the Saudis and other Arabs could not be							
persuaded to join this gathering.							
As a last thought before turning to what must be done	 let me make a quick						
comment on a relevant cultural factor. Arabic has two quite different words that are							
both translated as ""negotiation	 making a distinction that doesn't exist in either						
English or Hebrew. One word	 ""musaawama	 refers to the no-holds-barred					
15

bargaining process that takes place in bazaars between strangers who may never see							
each other again and who therefore feel no obligation not to scam each other.							
Another	 ""mufaawadhat	 describes the dignified formal discussions about matters of					
honor and high principle that take place on a basis of mutual respect and equality							
between statesmen who seek a continuing relationship.							
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's travel to Jerusalem was a grand act of							
statesmanship to initiate a process of mufaawadhat - relationship-building between							
leaders and their polities. So was the Arab peace initiative of 2002. It called for a							
response in kind. The West muttered approvingly but did not act. After a while							
Israel responded with intermittent	 somewhat oblique suggestions of willingness to						
haggle over terms. But an offer to bicker over the terms on which a grand gesture has							
been granted is	 not surprisingly	 seen as insultingly unresponsive.					
I cite this not to suggest that non-Arabs should adopt Arabic canons of							
thought	 but to make a point about diplomatic effectiveness. To move a negotiating						
partner in a desired direction	 one must understand how that partner understands						
things and help him to see a way forward that will bring him to an end he has been							
persuaded to want. One of the reasons we can't seem to move things as we desire in							
the Middle East is that we don't make much effort to understand how others reason							
and how they rank their interests. In the case of the Israel-Palestine conundrum	 we						
Americans are long on empathy and expertise about Israel and very	 very short on						
these for the various Arab parties. The essential militarism of U.S. policies in the							
Middle East adds to our difficulties. We have become skilled at killing Arabs. We							
have forgotten how to listen to them or persuade them.							
I am not myself an ""Arabist	 but I am old enough to remember when there						
were more than a few such people in the American diplomatic service. These were							
officers who had devoted themselves to the cultivation of understanding and empathy							
with Arab leaders so as to be able to convince these leaders that it was in their own							
interest to do things we saw as in our interest. If we still have such people	 we are						
hiding them well; we are certainly not applying their skills in our Middle East							
diplomacy.							
This brings me to a few thoughts about the Western and Arab interests at stake							
in the Holy Land and their implications for what must be done.							
In foreign affairs	 interests are the measure of all things. My assumption is that						
Americans and Norwegians	 indeed Europeans in general	 share common interests					
that require peace in the Holy Land. To my mind	 these interests include - but are	 of					
course	 not limited to - gaining security and acceptance for a democratic state of

Israel; eliminating the gross injustices and daily humiliations that foster Arab terrorism							
against Israel and its foreign allies and supporters	 as well as friendly Arab regimes;						
and reversing the global spread of religious strife and prejudice	 including	 very likely					
a revival of anti-Semitism in the West if current trends are not arrested. None of							
these aspirations can be fulfilled without an end to the Israeli occupation and freedom							
for Palestinians.							
Arab states	 like Saudi Arabia	 also have compelling reasons to want relief from					
occupation as well as self-determination for Palestinians. They may not be concerned							
to preserve Israel's democracy	 as we are	 but they share an urgent interest in ending					
the radicalization of their own populations	 curbing the spread of Islamist terrorism						
and eliminating the tensions with the West that the conflict in the Holy Land fuels.							
These are the concerns that have driven them to propose peace	 as they very clearly						
did eight years ago. For related reasons	 Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah has made						
inter-faith dialogue and the promotion of religious tolerance a main focus of his							
domestic and international policy.							
As the custodian of two of Islam's three sacred places of pilgrimage - Mecca							
and Medina - Saudi Arabia has long transcended its own notorious religious narrow-							
mindedness to hold the holy places in its charge open to Muslims of all sects and							
persuasions. This experience	 joined with Islamic piety	 reinforces a Saudi insistence					
on the exemption of religious pilgrimage to Jerusalem from political interference or							
manipulation. The Ottoman Turks were careful to ensure freedom of access for							
worship to adherents of the three Abrahamic faiths when they administered the city.							
It is an interest that Jews	 Christians	 and Muslims share.					
There is	 in short	 far greater congruity between Western and Arab interests					
affecting the Israel-Palestine dispute than is generally recognized. This can be the							
basis for creative diplomacy. The fact that this has not occurred reflects pathologies							
of political life in the United States that paralyze the American diplomatic imagination.							
Tomorrow's meeting may well demonstrate that	 the election of Barack Obama						
notwithstanding	 the United States is still unfit to manage the achievement of peace						
between Israel and the Arabs. If so	 it is in the American interest as well as everyone						
else's that others become the path-breakers	 enlisting the United States as best they						
can in support of what they achieve	 but not expecting America to overcome its						
incapacity to lead.							
Here	 I think	 there is a lesson to be drawn from the Norwegian experience in					
the 1990s. The Clinton Administration was happy to organize the public relations for •							
the Oslo accords but did not take ownership of them. It did little to protect them							
from subversion and overthrow	 and nothing to insist on their implementation. Only

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772410 Date: 08/31/2015							
a peace process that is protected from Israel's ability to manipulate American politics							
can succeed.							
This brings me to how Europeans and Arabs might work together to realize							
the objectives both share with most Americans: establishing internationally recognized							
borders for Israel	 securing freedom for the Palestinians	 and ending the stimulus to					
terrorism in the region and beyond it that strife in the Holy Land entails. I have only							
four suggestions to present today. I expect that more ideas will emerge from the							
discussion period. A serious effort to cooperate with the Arabs of the sort that •							
Norway is uniquely capable of contriving could lead to the development of still more							
options for joint or parallel action on behalf of peace.							
Now to my suggestions	 presented in ascending order of difficulty	 from the					
least to the most controversial.							
First	 get behind the Arab peace initiative. Saudi Arab culture frowns on self-						
promotion and the Kingdom is less gifted than most at public diplomacy. Political							
factors inhibit official Arab access to the Israeli press. The Israeli media have							
published some - mostly dismissive - commentary on the Arab peace initiative but left							
most Israelis ignorant of its contents and unfamiliar with its text. Why not buy space							
in the Israeli media to give Israelis a chance to read the Arab League declaration and							
consider the opportunities it presents? I suspect the Saudis	 as well as other members						
of the Arab League	 would consider it constructive for an outside party to do this. It						
might facilitate other sorts of cooperation with them in which European capabilities							
can also compensate for Arab reticence. The Turks and other non-Arab Muslims							
should be brought in as full participants in any such efforts. This wouldn't be bad for							
Europe's relations with both. By the way	 given the U.S. media's notorious one-						
sidedness and American ignorance about the Arab peace plan	 a well-targeted						
advertising campaign in the United States might not be a bad idea either.							
Second	 help create a Palestinian partner for peace. There can be no peace						
with Israel unless there are officials who are empowered by the Palestinian people to							
negotiate and ratify it. Israel has worked hard to divide the Palestinians so as to							
consolidate its conquest of their homeland. Saudi Arabia has several times sought to							
create a Palestinian peace partner for Israel by bringing Fatah	 Hamas	 and other					
factions together. On each occasion	 Israel	 with U.S. support	 has acted to preclude				
this. Active organization of non-American Western support for diplomacy aimed at							
restoring a unity government to the Palestinian Authority could make a big difference.							
The Obama Administration would be under strong domestic political pressure to join							
Israel in blocking a joint European-Arab effort to accomplish this. Under some							
circumstances	 however	 it might welcome being put to this test.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772410 Date: 08/31/2015							
Third	 reaffirm and enforce international law. The UN Security Council is						
charged with enforcing the rule of law internationally. In the case of the Middle East							
however	 the Council's position at the apex of the international system has served to						
erode and subvert the ideal of a rule-bound international order. Almost forty							
American vetoes have prevented the application to the Israeli occupying authorities of							
the Geneva Conventions	 the Nuremberg precedents	 human rights conventions	 and				
relevant Security Council directives. American diplomacy on behalf of the Jewish							
state has silenced the collective voice of the international community as Israel has							
illegally colonized and annexed broad swaths of occupied territory	 administered						
collective punishment to a captive people	 assassinated their political leaders						
massacred civilians	 barred UN investigators	 defied mandatory Security Council					
resolutions	 and otherwise engaged in scofflaw behavior	 usually with only the					
flimsiest of legally irrelevant excuses.							
If ethnic cleansing	 settlement activity	 and the like are not just ""unhelpful"" but					
illegal	 the international community should find a way to say so	 even if the UN					
Security Council cannot. Otherwise	 the most valuable legacy of Atlantic civilization -						
its vision of the rule of law - will be lost. When one side to a dispute is routinely							
exempted from principles	 all exempt themselves	 and the law of the jungle prevails.					
The international community needs collectively to affirm that Israel	 both as occupier						
and as regional military hegemon	 is legally accountable internationally for its actions.						
If the UN General Assembly cannot ""unite for peace"" to do what an incapacitated							
Security Council cannot	 member states should not shrink from working in						
conference outside the UN framework. All sides in the murder and mayhem in the							
Holy Land and beyond need to understand that they are not above the law. If this							
message is firmly delivered and enforced	 there will be a better chance for peace.						
Fourth	 set a deadline linked to an ultimatum. Accept that the United States						
will frustrate any attempt by the UN Security Council to address the continuing							
impasse between Israel and the Palestinians. Organize a global conference outside the							
UN system to coordinate a decision to inform the parties to the dispute that if they							
cannot reach agreement in a year	 one of two solutions will be imposed. Schedule a						
follow-up conference for a year later. The second conference would consider							
whether to recommend universal recognition of a Palestinian state in the area beyond							
Israel's 1967 borders or recognition of Israel's achievement of de jure as well as de							
facto sovereignty throughout Palestine (requiring Israel to grant all governed by it							
citizenship and equal rights at pain of international sanctions	 boycott	 and					
disinvestment). Either formula would force the parties to make a serious effort to							
strike a deal or to face the consequences of their recalcitrance. Either formula could							
be implemented directly by the states members of the international community.							
19

Admittedly	 any serious deadline would provoke a political crisis in Israel and lead to						
diplomatic confrontation with the United States as well as Israel	 despite the Obama						
Administration itself having proclaimed a one-year deadline in order to entice the							
Palestinians to tomorrow's talks. Yet both Israel and the United States would benefit							
immensely from peace with the Palestinians.							
Time is running out. The two-state solution may already have been overtaken							
by Israeli land grabs and settlement activity. Another cycle of violence is likely in the							
offing. If so	 it will not be local or regional	 but global in its reach. Israel's actions are					
delegitimizing and isolating it even as they multiply the numbers of those in the region							
and beyond who are determined to destroy it. Palestinian suffering is a reproach to all							
humanity that posturing alone cannot begin to alleviate. It has become a cancer on							
the Islamic body politic. It is infecting every extremity of the globe with the rage							
against injustice that incites terrorism.							
It is time to try new approaches. That is why the question of whether there is a							
basis for expanded diplomatic cooperation between Europeans and Arabs is such a							
timely one. And it is why I was pleased as well as honored to have been asked to set							
the stage for a discussion of this issue.

presentatives	 collaboration among American civilians from across						
the government has reached a new level in Pakistan	 Iraq	 Afghanistan	 Haiti and elsewhere. We				
are pooling the expertise of civilians at State and USAID	 as well as DoJ	 Commerce	 Treasury				
DHS	 HHS	 CDC	 and other agencies. The United States cannot succeed in these fragile states if				
these agencies aren't working together. That means organizing ourselves internally with a focus							
on integration	 cohesion	 and solving problems. For example	 the creation of the office of the				
Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan — with 16 agencies represented — was an							
innovation to overcome agency compartmentalization and to achieve a comprehensive strategy.							
The QDDR also draws on the talents of the Civilian Response Corps	 which has identified						
hundreds of civilian experts across the government who can be quickly deployed to conflict							
zones or fragile states. The Secretary sent the CRC's expeditionary conflict and security experts							
to Southern Sudan	 deploying them quickly enough to support our Sudanese partners as they						
prepare for potential independence after decades of conflict.							
The QDDR recommends building rapid response diplomatic teams and specially trained experts							
who can operate effectively over the longer term amidst conflict and instability. The State							
Department will focus on complex political crises	 and USAID on disaster response	 building on					
its abilities to get relief and recovery workers into the field within 24 hours after a disaster							
strikes. We will also create a joint operating framework and response plan that will allow State							
and USAID to work more effectively together and with other agencies.							
Although Afghanistan and Iraq have occupied much of the world's attention for the past eight							
years	 they are not the only places where diplomats and development experts are responsible for						
helping to shore up fragile and failing states	 deal with the consequences of political	 economic					
and social instability	 or join in common cause to prevent conflicts in the first place. Indeed						
since the end of the Cold War	 the State Department and USAID have steadily taken on more						
missions in difficult and dangerous places	 from Lebanon to Bosnia to East Timor.						
In Sudan we are mounting a civilian surge around the southern capital of Juba to prepare for the							
January 2011 referendum that will determine whether South Sudan secedes from the North.							
In Yemen	 our embassy is working to address economic conditions and the ravages of poverty in						
a country that has recently faced a secessionist movement in the south	 a rebellion in the north						
and a persistent threat from al Qaeda on the Arabian Peninsula. Through the diplomatic Friends							
of Yemen and concentrated efforts to stabilize fragile local communities and create opportunities							
for economic growth	 we are trying to help the Yemeni government provide better services for its						
citizens and to prevent conflict. The QDDR anticipates more situations requiring rapidly							
deployable civilian teams of diplomats	 stabilization and reconstruction experts	 and					
development professionals that can meet our needs in circumstances like Sudan or Yemen while							
also mounting larger efforts in other countries at the same time.							
Training a new generation of diplomats	 development professionals	 and peace-building experts					
will help us strengthen weak	 fragile or violent states and offer opportunities and hope to their						
citizens. Poverty and repression do not automatically engender terrorism but countries that are							
impoverished	 corrupt	 lawless or mired in a recurring cycle of conflict are more prone to

becoming havens for terrorists and other criminals. Al Qaeda first operated out of Sudan and							
bombed U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania before migrating to Afghanistan	 then a country						
notable for its poverty	 high infant mortality and repressive Taliban government. It is no						
coincidence that al Qaeda is most active today in underdeveloped nations such as Pakistan							
Somalia	 Yemen	 Mali	 Mauritania and Niger.				
Beyond terrorism and violent extremism	 the world already has witnessed too many tragic						
examples of what happens when good governance is absent. We have seen drug cartels exploit							
the absence of strong governing institutions and push countries on several continents to the brink							
of becoming narco-states. Elsewhere	 countries rich in minerals and diamonds have become						
epicenters of violence — including gender-based sexual violence -- because the central							
government is unwilling or unable to combat corruption	 regulate legitimate business	 or invest					
natural resources wealth in the country's infrastructure and people. And too often	 conflicts in						
fragile and weak states spill over borders	 creating humanitarian crises and spawning grounds for						
terrorists and global criminal networks elsewhere.							
On the positive side	 however	 we have also seen the effectiveness of civilian power working					
with our military to impede conflict and contribute to stability. In Liberia	 as fighting between						
rebel groups and government forces under the leadership of Charles Taylor intensified and the							
humanitarian situation deteriorated	 the United States undertook intense diplomatic efforts						
including public calls for Taylor's resignation	 as well as military deployments to the region to						
help shore up peacekeeping efforts of the Economic Community of West African States							
(ECOWAS). Taylor's resignation paved the way for a comprehensive peace agreement that led							
to the end of Liberia's conflict and set the stage for Liberia's stabilization and reconstruction							
efforts. Both the United Nations and the United States continue to partner with Liberia as it							
rebuilds social and economic infrastructure destroyed by years of conflict. Our future depends							
on the success of all these types of missions — from Iraq and Afghanistan to West Africa -- and							
our ability to mount more of them.							
The American people must understand that spending taxpayer dollars on diplomacy and							
development is in their interests	 especially when those investments support missions in conflict						
zones	 fragile states	 and states that can play a responsible role in their regions and in the world.					
And Congress	 which has a long tradition of bipartisan support for traditional diplomacy and						
development	 must appreciate the scale and scope of the reconstruction and stabilization						
missions that our civilians are being asked to undertake. Congress must provide the necessary							
funding now.							
The House and Senate have appropriated hundreds of billions of dollars for the military missions							
in Iraq and Afghanistan. The diplomatic and development activities represent a fraction of that							
cost	 yet the funding often gets bogged down in the old debates over foreign aid. We have to						
move beyond the past and treat diplomacy and development as national security priorities and							
smart investments in our future stability and security. We can succeed	 but only with the						
necessary Congressional leadership and support.							
Perhaps no one understands the urgency of this as much as Secretary Gates. As he said last							
August: ""Congress is part of the problem. When I sent my budget to the Hill for roughly $550

Our emphasis on civilian power is in keeping with America's history and traditions. The							
Marshall Plan was a civilian development initiative undertaken in partnership with European							
governments. President Kennedy founded the Peace Corps to show the world a different face of							
America decades before the term ""soft power"" was coined. American diplomats helped							
negotiate the reunification of Europe in 1991 without a shot fired. Meanwhile	 American						
civilians have enjoyed the world's admiration because of their spirit of innovation	 abundant						
goodwill	 and the audacious belief that technological	 social and political advances can and must					
be used to improve the lives of human beings around the world.							
The men and women who volunteer for our armed forces exemplify this spirit. So do the							
growing number of civilians who find ways to engage in public service. With the right balance of							
civilian and military power	 we can advance America's interests and values	 lead and support					
other nations in solving global problems	 and forge strong diplomatic and development						
partnerships with traditional allies and newly emerging powers. And we can rise to the							
challenges of the world in the 21st century and meet the tests of America's global leadership.

uttress the idea that global warming is real. In the two weeks after the e-mails went									
public	 one Cato scholar gave more than twenty media interviews trumpeting the alleged scandal. But five independent inquiries								
have since exonerated the researchers	 and nothing was found in their e-mails or data to discredit the scientific consensus on								
global warming. •									
Nevertheless	 the controversy succeeded in spreading skepticism about climate change. Even though the National Oceanic								
and Atmospheric Administration recently issued a report concluding that the evidence for global warming is unequivocal	 more								
Americans are convinced than at any time since 1997 that scientists have exaggerated the seriousness of global warming. The									
Kochs promote this statistic on their company's Web site but do not mention the role that their funding has played in fostering									
such doubt.									
In a 2002 memo	 the Republican political consultant Frank Luntz wrote that so long as ""voters believe there is no consensus								
about global warming within the scientific community' the status quo would prevail. The key for opponents of environmental									
reform	 he said	 was to question the science—a public-relations strategy that the tobacco industry used effectively for years to							
forestall regulation. The Kochs have funded many sources of environmental skepticism	 such as the Heritage Foundation	 which							
has argued that ""scientific facts gathered in the past 10 years do not support the notion of catastrophic human-made warming.""									
The brothers have given money to more obscure groups	 too	 such as the Independent Women's Forum	 which opposes the						
presentation of global warming as a scientific fact in American public schools. Until 2008	 the group was run by Nancy								
Pfotenhauer	 a former lobbyist for Koch Industries. Mary Beth Jarvis	 a vice-president of a Koch subsidiary	 is on the group's						
board.									
Naomi Oreskes	 a professor of history and science studies at the University of California	 San Diego	 is the co-author of						
Merchants of Doubt	 a new book that chronicles various attempts by American industry to manipulate public opinion on								
science. She noted that the Kochs	 as the heads of ""a company with refineries and pipelines	 have ""a lot at stake."" She added							
If the answer is to phase out fossil fuels	 a different group of people are going to be making money	 so we shouldn't be							
surprised that they're fighting tooth and nail.""									
David Koch told New York that he was unconvinced that global warming has been caused by human activity. Even if it has									
been	 he said	 the heating of the planet will be beneficial	 resulting in longer growing seasons in the Northern Hemisphere. ""The						
Earth will be able to support enormously more people because far greater land area will be available to produce food	 he said.								
n the mid-eighties	 the Kochs provided millions of dollars to George Mason University	 in Arlington	 Virginia	 to set up another					
think tank. Now known as the Mercatus Center	 it promotes itself as ""the world's premier university source for market-oriented								
ideas—bridging the gap between academic ideas and real-world problems."" Financial records show that the Koch family									
foundations have contributed more than thirty million dollar's to George Mason	 much of which has gone to the Mercatus								
Center	 a nonprofit organization. ""It's ground zero for deregulation policy in Washington	 Rob Stein	 the Democratic strategist						
said. It is an unusual arrangement. ""George Mason is a public university	 and receives public funds	 Stein noted. ""Virginia is							
hosting an institution that the Kochs practically control.""									
The founder of the Mercatus Center is Richard Fink	 formerly an economist. Fink heads Koch Industries' lobbying								
operation in Washington. In addition	 he is the president of the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation	 the president of the							
Claude R. Lambe Charitable Foundation	 a director of the Fred C. and Mary R. Koch Foundation	 and a director and co-							
founder	 with David Koch	 of the Americans for Prosperity Foundation.							
Fink	 with his many titles	 has become the central nervous system of the Kochtopus. He appears to have supplanted Ed							
Crane	 the head of the Cato Institute	 as the brothers' main political lieutenant. Though David remains on the board at Cato							
Charles Koch has fallen out with Crane. Associates suggested to me that Crane had been insufficiently respectful of Charles's									
management philosophy	 which he distilled into a book called ""The Science of Success	 and trademarked under the name							
Market-Based Management	 or M.B.M. In the book. Charles recommends instilling a company's corporate culture with the								
competitiveness of the marketplace.. Koch describes M.B.M. as a ""holistic system"" containing ""five dimensions: vision	 virtue								
and talents	 knowledge processes	 decision rights and incentives."" A top Cato Institute official told me that Charles ""thinks he's							
a genius. He's the emperor	 and he's convinced he's wearing clothes."" Fink	 by contrast	 has been far more embracing of						
Charles's ideas. (Fink	 like the Kochs	 declined to. be interviewed.)							
At a 1995 conference for philanthropfsts	 Fink adopted the language of economics when speaking about the Mercatus								
Center's purpose. He said that grant-makers should use think tanks and political-action groups to convert intellectual raw									
materials into policy ""products.""									
The Wall Street Journal has called the Mercatus Center ""the most important think tank you've never heard of	 and noted								
that fourteen of the twenty-three regulations that President George W. Bush placed on a ""hit list"" had been suggested first by									
Mercatus scholars. Fink told the paper that the Kochs have ""other means of fighting [their] battles	 and that the Mercatus								
Center does riot actively promote the company's private interests. But Thomas McGarity	 a law professor at the University of								
Texas	 who specializes in environmental issues	 told me that ""Koch has been constantly in trouble with the E.P.A.	 and						
Mercatus has constantly hammered on the agency."" An environmental lawyer who has clashed with the Mercatus Center called									
it ""a means of laundering economic aims."" The lawyer explained the strategy: ""You take corporate money and give it to a									
neutral-sounding think tank	 which ""hires people with pedigrees and academic degrees who put out credible-seeming studies.								
But they all coincide perfectly with the economic interests of their funders.""									
In 1997	 for instance	 the E.P.A. moved to reduce surface ozone	 a form of pollution caused	 in part	 by emissions from oil				
refineries. Susan Dudley	 an economist who became a top official at the 'Mercatus Center	 criticized the proposed rule. The							
E.P.A.	 she argued	 had not taken into account that smog-free skies would result in more cases of skin cancer. She projected that							
if pollution were controlled it would cause up to eleven thousand additional cases of skin cancer each year.									
In 1999	 the District of Columbia Circuit Court took 'up Dudley's smog argument. Evaluating the E.P.A. rule	 the court							
found that the E.P.A. had ""explicitly disregarded"" the ""possible health benefits of ozone."" In another part of the opinion	 the								
court ruled	 2-1	 that the E.P.A. had overstepped its authority in calibrating standards for ozone emissions. As the Constitutional							
Accountability Center	 a think tank	 revealed	 the judges in the majority had previously attended legal junkets	 on a Montana					
ranch	 that were arranged by the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment—a group funded by Koch family								
foundations. The judges have claimed that the ruling was unaffected by their attendance.									
deas don't happen on their own	 Matt Kibbe	 the president of Freedom Works	 a Tea Party advocacy group	 told me.					
Throughout history	 ideas need patrons."" The Koch brothers	 after helping to create Cato and Mercatus	 concluded that think						
tanks alone were not enough to effect change. They needed a mechanism to deliver those ideas to the street	 and to attract the								
public's support. in 1984	 David Koch and Richard Fink created yet another organization. and Kibbe joined them. The group								
Citizens for a Sound Economy	 seemed like a grassroots movement	 but according to the Center for Public Integrity it was							
sponsored principally by the Kochs	 who provided $7.9 million between 1986 and 19.93. Its mission	 Kibbe said	 ""was to take						
these heavy ideas and translate them for mass America.... We read the same literature Obama did about nonviolent									
revolutions--Saul _Minsky	 Gandhi	 Martin Luther King. We studied the idea of the Boston Tea Party as an example of							
nonviolent social change. We learned we needed boots on the ground to sell ideas	 not candidates."" Within a few years	 the							
group had mobilized fifty paid field workers	 in twenty-six states	 to rally voters behind the Kochs' agenda. David and Charles							
according to one participant	 were ""very controlling	 very top down. You can't build an organization with them. They run it.""							
Around this time	 the brothers faced a political crisis. In 1989	 the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs investigated							
their business and released a scathing report accusing Koch Oil of ""a widespread and sophisticated scheme to steal crude oil									
from Indians and others through fraudulent mismeasuring."" The Kochs admitted that they had improperly taken thirty-one									
million dollars' worth of crude oil	 but said that it had been accidental. Charles Koch told committee investigators that oil								
measurement is ""a very uncertain art.""									
To defend its reputation	 Koch IndustrieS hired Robert Strauss	 then a premier Washington lobbyist; the company soon							
opened an office in the city. A grand jury was convened to investigate the allegations	 but it eventually disbanded	 without							
issuing criminal charges. According to the Senate report	 after the committee hearings Koch operatives delved into the personal								
lives of committee staffers	 even questioning an ex-wife. Senate investigators were upset by the Kochs' tactics. Kenneth Batten								
the counsel to the Senate committee	 said	 ""These people have amassed such unaccountable power!'							
.'									
By •1993	 when Bill Clinton became President	 Citizens for a Sound Economy had become a prototype for the kind of							
corporate-backed opposition campaigns that have proliferated during the Obama era. The group waged a successful assault on									
Clinton's proposed B.T.U. tax on energy	 for instance	 running advertisements	 staging media events	 and targeting opponents.					
And it mobilized anti-tax rallies outside the Capitol—rallies that NPR described as ""designed to strike fear into the hearts of									
wavering Democrats."" Dan Glickman	 a former Democratic congressman from Wichita	 who supported the B.I.U. tax	 recalled						
I'd been in Congress eighteen years. The Kochs actually engaged against me and funded my opponent. They used a lot of									
'resources and effort—their employees	 too."" Glickman suffered a surprise defeat. ""I can't prove it	 but I think I was probably							
their victim	 he said.								
The Kochs continued to disperse their money	 creating slippery organizations with generic-sounding names	 and this made							
it difficult to ascertain the extent of their influence in Washington. In 1990	 Citizens for a Sound Economy created a spinoff								
group	 Citizens for the Environment	 which called acid rain and other environmental problems ""myths."" When the							
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette investigated the matter	 it discovered that the spinoff group had ""no citizen membership of its own.""								
In 1997	 another Senate investigation began looking into what a minority report called ""an audacious plan to pour millions								
of dollars in contributions into Republican campaigns nationwide without disclosing the amount or source	 in order to evade								
campaign-finance laws. A shell corporation	 Triad Management	 had paid more than three million dollars for attack ads in							
twenty-six House races and three Senate races. More than half of the advertising money came from an obscure nonprofit group									
the Economic Education Trust. The Senate committee's minority report suggested that ""the trust was financed in whole or in									
part by Charles and David Koch of Wichita	 Kansas."" The brothers were suspected of having secretly paid for the attack ads								
most of which aired in states where Koch Industries did business. In Kansas	 where Triad Management was especially active								
the funds may have played a decisive role in four of six federal races. The Kochs	 when asked by reporters if they had given the								
money	 refused to comment. In i998	 however	 the Wall Street Journal confirmed that a consultant on the Kochs' payroll had						
been involved in the scheme. Charles Lewis	 of the Center for Public Integrity	 described the scandal as ""historic. Triad was the							
first time a major corporation used a cutout""—a front operation—""in a threatening way. Koch Industries was the poster child of									
a company run amok.""									
uring the Clinton Administration	 the energy industry faced increased scrutiny and regulation. In the mid-nineties	 the Justice							
Department filed two lawsuits against Koch Industries	 claiming that it was responsible for more than three hundred oil spills								
which had released an estimated three million gallons of oil into lakes and rivers. The penalty was potentially as high as two									
hundred and fourteen million dollars. In a settlement. Koch Industries paid a record thirty-million-dollar civil fine	 and agreed to								
spend five million dollars on environmental projects.									
In 1999	 a jury found Koch Industries guilty of negligence and malice in the deaths of two Texas teen-agers in an explosion								
that resulted from a leaky underground butane pipeline. (In 2001	 the company paid an undisclosed settlement.) And in the final								
months of the Clinton Presidency the Justice Department levelled a ninety-seven-count indictment against the company	 for								
covering up the discharge of ninety-one tons of benzene	 a carcinogen	 from its refinery in Corpus Christi	 Texas. The company						
was liable •for three hundred and fifty million dollars in fines	 and four Koch employees faced up to thirty-five years in prison.								
The Koch Petroleum Group eventually pleaded guilty to one criminal charge of covering up environmental violations	 including								
the falsification of documents	 and paid a twenty-million-dollar fine. David Uhlmann	 a career prosecutor who	 at the time						
headed the environmental-crimes section at the Justice Department	 described the suit as ""one of the most significant cases ever								
brought under the Clean Air Act."" He added	 ""Environmental crimes are almost always motivated by economics and arrogance								
and in the Koch case there was a healthy dose of both.""									
During the 2000 election campaign	 Koch Industries spent some nine hundred thousand dollars to support the candidacies								
of George W. Bush and other Republicans. During the Bush years	 Koch Industries and other fossil-fuel companies enjoyed								
remarkable prosperity. The 2005 energy bill	 which Hillary Clinton dubbed the Dick Cheney Lobbyist Energy Bill	 offered							
enormous subsidies and tax breaks for energy companies. The Kochs have cast themselves as deficit hawks	 but	 according to a							
study by Media Matters	 their companies have benefitted from nearly a hundred million dollars in government contracts since								
2000									
In 2004	 Citizens for a Sound Economy was accused of illegitimately throwing its weight behind Bush's reelection. The								
group's Oregon branch had attempted to get Ralph Nader on the Presidential ballot	 in order to dilute Democratic support for								
John Kerry. Critics argued that it was illegal	 for a tax-exempt nonprofit organization to donate its services for partisan political								
purposes. (A complaint was filed with the Federal Election Commission; it was dismissed.)									
That year	 internal rivalries at Citizens for a Sound Economy caused the organization to split apart. David Koch and Fink								
started a new group	 Americans for Prosperity	 and they hired Tim Phillips to run it. Phillips was a political veteran who had							
worked with Ralph Reed	 the evangelical leader and Republican activist	 co-founding Century Strategies	 a campaign-						
consulting company that became notorious for its ties to the disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff. Phillips's online biography									
describes him as an expert in ""grasstops"" and ""grassroots"" political organizing. The Kochs' choice of Phillips signalled an even									
greater toughness. The conservative operative Grover Norquist	 who is known for praising ""throat slitters"" in politics	 called							
Phillips ""a grownup who can make things happen.""									
Last year	 Phillips told the Financial Times that Americans for Prosperity had only eight thousand registered members.								
Currently	 its Web site claims that the group has ""1.2 million activists."" Whatever its size	 the Kochs' political involvement has							
been intense; a former employee of the Cato Institute told me that Americans for Prosperity ""was micromanaged by the Kochs.""									
And the brothers' investment may well have paid off: Americans for Prosperity	 in concert with the family's other								
organizations	 has been instrumental in disrupting the Obama Presidency.								
In January	2008	 Charles Koch wrote in his company newsletter that America could be on the verge of ""the greatest loss of							
liberty and prosperity since the 1930s."" That October	 Americans for Prosperity held a conference of conservative operatives at								
a Marriott hotel outside Washington. Erick Erickson	 the editor-in-chief of the conservative blog RedState.com	 took the lectern							
thanked David Koch	 and vowed to ""unite and fiaht ... the armies of the left!"" Sodn after Obama assumed office	 Americans							
for Prosperity launched ""Porkulus"" rallies against Obama's stimulus-spending measures. Then the Mercatus Center released a									
report claiming that stimulus funds had been directed disproportionately toward Democratic districts; eventually	 the author was								
forced to correct the report	 but not before Rush Limbaugh	 citing.the paper	 had labelled Obama's program ""a slush fund	 and					
Fox News and other conservative outlets had echoed the sentiment. (Phil Kerpen	 the vice-president for policy at Americans for								
Prosperity	 is a contributor to the Fox News Web site. Another officer at Americans for Prosperity	 Walter Williams	 often						
guest-hosts for Limbaugh.)									
Americans for Prosperity also created an offshoot	 Patients United Now	 which organized what Phillips has estimated to be							
more than three hundred rallies against health-care reform. Atone rally	 an effigy of a Democratic congressman was hung; at								
another	 protesters unfurled a banner depicting corpses from Dachau. The group also helped organize the ""Kill the Bill"" protests								
outside the Capitol	 in March	 where Democratic supporters of health-care reform alleged that they were spat on and cursed at.							
Phillips was a featured speaker.									
Americans for Prosperity has held at least eighty events targeting cap-and-trade legislation	 which is aimed at making								
industries pay for the air pollution that they create. Speakers for the group claimed	 with exaggeration	 that even back-yard							
barbecues and kitchen stoves would be taxed. The group was also involved in the attacks on Obama's ""green jobs"" czar	 Van								
Jones	 and waged a crusade against international climate talks. Casting	 his group as a champion of ordinary workers who would							
be hurt by environmentalists	 Phillips went to Copenhagen last year and staged a protest outside the United Nations conference								
on climate change	 declaring	 ""We're a grassroots organization.... 1 think it's unfortunate when wealthy children of wealthy							
families . want to send unemployment rates in the United States up to twenty per cent.""									
Grover Norquist	 who holds a weekly meeting for conservative leaders in Washington	 including representatives from							
Americans for Prosperity	 told me that last summer's raucous rallies were pivotal in undermining Obama's agenda. The								
Republican leadership in Congress	 he said	 ""couldn't have clone it without August	 when people went out on the streets. It						
discouraged deal-makers""—Republicans who might otherwise have worked constructively with Obama. Moreover	 the								
appearance of growing public opposition to Obama affected corporate donors on K Street. ""K Street is a three-billion-dollar									
weathervane	 Norquist said. ""When Obama was strong	 the Chamber of Commerce said	 'We can work with the Obama						
Administration.' But that changed when thousands of people went into the street and 'terrorized' congressmen. August is what									
changed it. Now that Obama is weak	 people are getting tough.""								
As the first anniversary of Obama's election approached	 David Koch came to the Washington area to attend a triumphant								
Americans for Prosperity gathering. Obama's poll numbers were falling fast. Not .a single Republican senator was working with									
the Administration on health care	 or much else. Pundits were writing about Obama's political ineptitude	 and Tea Party groups							
were accusing the President of initiating ""a government takeover."" In a speech	 Koch said	 ""Days like today bring to reality the							
vision of our board of directors when we started this organization	 five years ago."" He went on	 ""We envisioned a mass							
movement	 a state-based one	 but national in scope	 of hundreds of thousands of American citizens from all walks of life						
standing up and fighting for the economic freedoms that made our nation the most prosperous society in history.... Thankfully									
the stirrings from California to Virginia	 and from Texas to Michigan	 show that more and more of our fellow-citizens are							
beginning to see the same truths as we do."" .									
While Koch didn't explicitly embrace the Tea Party movement that day	 more recently he has come close to doing so								
praising it for demonstrating the ""powerful visceral hostility in the body politic against the massive increase in government									
power	 the massive efforts to socialize this country."" Charles Koch	 in a newsletter sent to his seventy thousand employees							
compared the Obama Administration to the regime of the Venezuelan strongman Hugo Chavez. The Kochs' sense of									
imperilment is somewhat puzzling. Income inequality in America is greater than it has been since the nineteen-twenties	 and								
since the seventies the tax rates of the wealthiest have fallen more than those of the middle class. Yet the brothers' message has									
evidently resonated with voters: a recent poll found that fifty-five per cent of Americans agreed that Obama is a socialist.									
Americans for Prosperity	 meanwhile	 has announced that it will spend an additional forty-five million dollars before the							
midterm elections	 in November. Although the group is legally prohibited from directly endorsing candidates	 it nonetheless							
plans to target some fifty House races and half a dozen Senate races	 staging rallies	 organizing door-to-door canvassing	 and						
running ads aimed at ""educating voters about where candidates stand.""									
Though the Kochs have slowed Obama's momentum	 their larger political battle is far from won. Richard Fink	 interviewed							
by FrumForum.com this spring	 said	 ""If you look at where we've gone from the year 2000 to now	 with the expansion of						
government spending and a debt burden that threatens to bankrupt the country	 it doesn't look very good at all."" He went on	 ""It							
looks like the infrastructure that was built and ruirtitred has not carried the day."" He suggested that the Kochs needed ""to get									
more into the practical	 day-to-day issues of governing.""								
n 1991	 David Koch was badly injured in a plane crash.in Los Angeles. He was the sole passenger in first class to survive. As he								
was recovering	 a routine physical exam led to the discovery of prostate cancer. Koch received treatment	 settled down	 started a						
family	 and reconsidered his life. As he told Portfolio	 ""When you're the only one who survived in the front of the plane and							
everyone.else died—yeah	 you think	 'My God	 the good Lord spared me for some greater purpose.' My joke is that I've been						
busy ever since	 doing all the good work 1 can think of	 so He can have confidence in me.""							
Koch began giving spectacularly large donations to the arts and sciences. And he became a patron of cancer research									
focussing on prostate cancer. In addition to his gifts to Sloan-Kettering	 he gave fifteen million dollars to New York-								
Presbyterian Hospital	 a hundred and twenty-five million to M.I.T. for cancer research	 twenty million to Johns Hopkins							
University	 and twenty-five million to the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center	 in Houston. In response to his generosity	 Sloan-						
Kettering gave Koch its Excellence in Corporate Leadership Award. In 2004	 President Bush named him to the National Cancer								
Advisory Board	 which guides the National.Cancer Institute.								
Koch's corporate and political roles	 however	 may pose conflicts of interest. For example	 at the same time that David						
Koch has been casting himself as a champion in the fight against cancer	 Koch Industries has been lobbying to prevent the								
E.P.A. from classifying formaldehyde	 which the company produces in great quantities	 as a ""known carcinogen"" in humans.							
Scientists have long known that formaldehyde causes cancer in rats	 and several major scientific studies have concluded								
that formaldehyde causes cancer in human beings—including one published last year by the National Cancer Institute	 on								
•whose advisory board Koch sits. The study tracked twenty-five thousand patients for an average of forty years; subjects exposed									
to higher amounts of formaldehyde had significantly higher rates of leukemia. These results helped lead an expert panel within									
the National Institutes of Health to conclude that formaldehyde should be categorized as a known carcinogen	 and be strictly								
controlled by the government. Corporations have resisted regulations on formaldehyde for decades	 however	 and Koch							
Industries has been a large funder of members of Congress who have stymied the E.P.A.	 requiring it to defer new regulations								
until more studies are completed.									
Koch Industries became a major producer of the chemical in 2005	 after it bought Georgia-Pacific	 the paper and wood-							
products company	 for twenty-one billion dollars. Georgia-Pacific manufactures formaldehyde in its chemical division	 and uses							
it to produce various wood products	 such as plywood and laminates. Its annual production capacity for formaldehyde is 2.2								
billion pounds. Last December	 Traylor Champion	 Georgia-Pacific's vice-president of environmental affairs	 sent a formal						
letter of protest to federal health authorities. He wrote that the company ""strongly disagrees"" with the N.I.H. panel's conclusion									
that formaldehyde should be treated as a known human carcinogen. David Koch did not recuse himself from the National									
Cancer Advisory Board	 or divest himself of company stock	 while his company was directly lobbying the government to keep							
formaldehyde on the market. (A board spokesperson said that the issue of formaldehyde had not come up.)									
James Fluff	 an associate director at the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences	 a division of the N.I.H.	 told						
me that it was ""disgusting"" for Koch to be serving on the National Cancer Advisory Board: ""It's just not good for public health.									
Vested interests should not be on the board."" He 'went on	 ""Those boards are very important. They're very influential as to								
whether N.C.I. goes into formaldehyde or not. Billions of dollars are involved in formaldehyde.""									
Harold Vannus	 the director of the National Cancer Institute	 knows David Koch from Memorial Sloan-Kettering	 which he						
used to run. He said that	 at Sloan-Kettering	 ""a lot of people who gave to us had large business interests. The one thing we							
wouldn't tolerate in our board members is tobacco."" When told of Koch Industries' stance on formaldehyde	 Varmus said that								
he was ""surprised.""									
he David H. Koch Hall of Human Origins	 at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History	 is a multimedia							
exploration of the theory that mankind evolved in response to climate change. At the main entrance	 viewers are confronted								
with a giant graph charting the Earth's temperature over the past ten million years	 which notes that it is far cooler now than it								
was ten thousand years ago. Overhead	 the text reads	 ""HUMANS EVOLVED IN RESPONSE TO A CHANGING WORLD."" The							
message	 as amplified by the exhibit's Web site	 is that ""key human adaptations evolved in response to							
environmental instability."" Only at the end of the exhibit	 under the headline ""OUR SURVIVAL CHALLENGE	 is it noted							
that levels of carbon dioxide are higher now than they have ever been	 and that they are projected to increase								
dramatically in the next century. No cause is given for this development; no mention is made of any possible role									
played by fossil fuels. The exhibit makes it seem part of a natural continuum. The accompanying text says	 ""During								
the period in which humans evolved	 Earth's temperature and the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere								
fluctuated together."" An interactive game in the exhibit suggests that humans will continue to adapt to climate									
change in the future. People may build ""underground cities;"" developing ""short	 compact bodies"" or ""curved spines								
so that ""moving around in tight spaces will be no problem.""									
Such ideas uncannily echo the Koch message. The company's January newsletter to employees	 for instance	 argueS that							
fluctuations in the earth's climate predate humanity	 and concludes	 ""Since we can't control Mother Nature	 let's figure out						
how to get along with her changes."" Joseph Romm	 a physicist who runs the Web site ClirnateProgress.org	 is infuriated by the							
Smithsonian's presentation. ""The whole exhibit whitewashes the modern climate issue	 he said. ""I think the Kochs wanted to								
be seen as some sort of high-minded company	 associated with the greatest natural-history and science museum in the country.								
But the truth is	 the exhibit is underwritten by big-time polluters	 who are underground .funders of action to stop efforts to deal							
with this threat to humanity. I think the Smithsonian should have drawn the line.""									
Cristian Samper	 the museum's director	 said that the exhibit is not about climate change	 and described Koch as ""one of the						
best donors we've had	 in my tenure here	 because he's very interested in the content	 but completely hands off."" He noted	 ""1.					
don't know all the details.of his involvement in other issues.""									
The Kochs have long depended on the public's not knowing all the details about them. They have been content to operate what									
David Koch has called ""the largest company that you've never heard of."" But with the growing prominence of the Tea Party									
and with increased awareness of the Kochs' ties to the movement	 the brothers may find it harder to deflect scrutiny. Recently								
President °barna took aim at the Kochs' political network. Speaking at a Democratic National Committee fund-raiser	 in								
Austin	 he warned supporters that the Supreme Court's recent ruling in the Citizens United case—which struck down laws								
prohibiting direct Corporate spending on campaigns—had made it even easier for big companies to hide behind ""groups with									
harmless-sounding names like Americans for Prosperity."" Obama said	 ""They don't have to say who	 exactly	 Americans for						
Prosperity are. You don't know if it's a foreign-controlled corporation""—or even	 he added	 ""a big oil company."""	"UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015

COVERT OPERATIONS
The billionaire brothers who are waging a war against Obama.
by Jane Mayetmo,
(.s..
David H. Koch in 1996. He and his brother Charles are lifelong libertarians and have quietly given more than a hundred million
dollars to right-wing causes.
On May 17th, a black-tie audience at the Metropolitan Opera House applauded as a tall, jovial-looking billionaire tOok the
stage. It was the seventieth annual spring gala of American Ballet Theatre, and David H. Koch was being celebrated for his
generosity as a member of the board of trustees; he had recently donated $2.5 million toward the company's upcoming season,
and had given many millions before that. Koch received an award while flanked by two of the gala's co-chairs, Blaine Trump,
in a peach-colored gown, and Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, in emerald green. Kennedy's mother, Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis, had been a patron of the ballet and, coincidentally, the previous owner of a Fifth Avenue apartment that Koch had
bought, in 1995, and then sold, eleven years later, for thirty-two million dollars, having found it too small.
The gala marked the social ascent of Koch, who, at the age of seventy, has become one of the city's most prominent
philanthropists. In 2008, he donated a hundred million dollars to modernize. Lincoln Center's New York State Theatre building,
which now bears his name. He has given twenty million to the American Museum of Natural History, whose dinosaur wing is
named for him. This spring, after noticing the decrepit state of the fountains outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Koch
pledged at least ten million dollars for their renovation. He is a trustee of the museum, perhaps the most coveted social prize in

the city, and serves on the board of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, where, after he donated more than forty million
dollars, an endowed chair and a research center were named for him.
One dignitary was conspicuously absent from the gala: the event's third honorary co-chair, Michelle Obama. Her office
said that a scheduling conflict had prevented her from attending. Yet had the First Lady shared the stage with Koch it might
have created an awkward tableau. In Washington, Koch is best known as part of a family that has repeatedly funded stealth
attacks on the federal government, and on the Obama Administration in particular.
With his brother Charles, who is seventy-four, David Koch owns virtually all of Koch Industries, a conglomerate,
headquartered in Wichita. Kansas, whose annual revenues are estimated to be a hundred billion dollars. The company has
grown spectacularly since their father, Fred, died, in 1967, and the brothers took charge. The Kochs operate oil refineries in
Alaska, Texas, and Minnesota, and control some four thousand miles of pipeline. Koch Industries owns Brawny paper towels,
Dixie. cups, Georgia-Pacific lumber, Staimnaster carpet, and Lycra, among other products. Forbes ranks it as the second-largest
private company in the country, after Cargill, and its consistent profitability has made David and Charles Koch—who, years
ago, bought out two other brothers—among the richest Men in America. Their combined fortune of thirty-five billion dollars is
exceeded only by those of Bill Gates and Warren Buffett.
The Kochs are longtime libertarians who believe in drastically lower personal and corporate taxes, minimal social services
for the needy, and much less oversight of industry—especially environmental regulation. These views dovetail with the
brothers' corporate interests. In a study released this spring, the University of Massachusetts at Amherst's Political Economy
Research Institute named Koch Industries one of the top ten air polluters in the United States.- And Greenpeace issued a report
identifying the company as a ""kingpin of climate science denial."" The report showed that, from 2005 to 2008, the Kochs vastly
outdid ExxonMobil in giving money to organizations fighting legislation related to climate change, unclerwriting'a huge
network of foundations, think tanks, and political front groups. Indeed, the brothers have funded opposition campaigns against
so many Obama Administration policies—from health-care reform to the economic-stimulus program----that, in political circles,
their ideological network is known as the Kochtopus.
In a statement, Koch Industries said that the Greenpeace report ""distorts the environmental record of our companies."" And. .
David Koch, in a recent, admiring article about him in New York, protested that the ""radical press"" had turned his family into
""whipping boys,"" and had exaggerated its influence on American politics. But Charles Lewis, the founder of the Center for
Public Integrity, a nonpartisan watchdog group, said, ""The Kochs are on a whole different level. There's no one else who has
spent this much money. The sheer dimension of it is what sets them apart. They have a pattern of lawbreaking, political
manipulation, and obfuscation. I've been in Washington since Watergate, and I've never seen anything like it. They are the
Standard Oil of our times.""
few weeks after the Lincoln Center gala, the advocacy wing of the Americans for Prosperity Foundation—an organization that
David Koch started, in 2004—held a different kind of gathering. Over the July 4th weekend, a summit called Texas Defending
the American Dream took place in a chilly hotel ballroom in Austin. Though Koch freely promotes his philanthropic ventures,
lie did not attend the summit, and his name was not in evidence. And on this occasion the audience was roused not by a,dance
performance but by a series of speakers denouncing President Barack Obama. Peggy Venable, the organizer of the summit,
warned that Administration officials ""have a socialist visiOn for this country.""
Five hundred people attended the summit, which served, in part, as a training session for Tea Party activists in Texas. An
advertisement cast the event as a populist uprising against vested corporate power. ""Today, the voices of average Americans are
being drowned out by lobbyists and special interests,"" it said. ""But you can do something about it."" The pitch made no mention
of its corporate funders. The White House has expressed frustration that such sponsors have largely eluded public notice. David .
Axelrod, Obama's senior adviser, said, ""What they don't say is that, in part, this is a grassroots citizens' movement brought to
you by a bunch of oil billionaires.""
In April, 2009, Melissa Cohlmia, a company spokesperson; denied that the Kochs had direct links to the Tea Party, saying
that Americans for Prosperity is ""an independent organization and Koch companies do not in any way direct their activities.""
.Later, she issued a statement: ""No funding has been provided by Koch companies, the Koch foundations, or Charles Koch or
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015
David Koch specifically to support the tea parties."" David Koch told New York, ""I've never been to a tea-party event. No one
representing the tea party has ever even approached me.""
At the lectern in Austin, however, Venable—a longtime political operative who draws a salary from Americans for
Prosperity, and who has worked for Koch-funded political groups since 1994—spoke less warily: ""We love what the Tea
Parties are doing, because that's how we're going to take back America!"" she declared, as the crowd cheered. In a subsequent
interview, she described herself as an early member of the movement, joking, ""I was part of the Tea Party before it was cool!""
She explained that the role of Americans for Prosperity was to help ""educate"" Tea Party activists on policy details, and to give
them ""next-step training"" after their rallies, so that their political energy could be channelled ""more effectively."" And she noted
that Americans for Prosperity had provided Tea Party activists with lists of elected officials to target. She said of the Kochs.
""They're certainly our people. David's the chairman of our board. I've certainly met with them, and I'm very appreciative Of
what they do.""
Venable honored several Tea Party ""citizen leaders"" at the summit. The Texas branch of Americans for Prosperity gave its
Blogger of the Year Award to a young woman named Sibyl West. On June 14th, West, writing on her site, described Obama as
the ""cokehead in chief."" In an online thread, West speculated that the President was exhibiting symptoms of ""demonic
possession (aka schizophrenia, etc.)."" The summit featured several paid speakers, including Janine Turner, the actress best
known for her role on the television series ""Northern Exposure."" She declared, ""They don't want our children to know about
their rights. They don't want our children to know about a God!""
During a catered lunch, Venable introduced Ted Cruz, a former solicitor general of Texas, who told the crowd that Obama
was ""the most radical President ever to occupy the Oval Office,"" and had hidden from voters a secret agenda—""the government
taking over our economy and our lives."" Countering Obama, Cruz proclaimed, was the epic fight of our generation!"" As the
crowd rose to its feet and cheered, he quoted the defiant words of a Texan at the Alamo: ""Victory, or death!""
Americans for Prosperity has worked closely with the Tea Party since the movement's inception. In the weeks before the
first Tax Day protests, in April, 2009, Americans for Prosperity hosted a Web site offering supporters ""Tea Party Talking
Points."" The Arizona branch urged people to send tea bags to Obama; the Missouri branch urged members to sign up for
""Taxpayer Tea Party Registration"" and provided directions to nine protests. The group continues to stoke the rebellion. The
North Carolina branch recently launched a ""Tea Party Finder"" Web site, advertised as ""a hub for all the Tea Parties in North
Carolina.""
The anti-government fervor infusing the 2010 elections represents a political triumph for the Kochs. By giving money to
""educate,"" fund, and organize Tea Party protesters, they have helped turn their private agenda into a mass movement. Bruce
Bartlett, a conservative economist and a historian, who once worked at the National Center for Policy Analysis, a Dallas-based
think tank that the Kochs fund, said, ""The problem with the whole libertarian movement is that it's been all chiefs and no
Indians. There haven't been any actual people, like voters, who give a crap about it. So the problem for the Kochs has been
trying to create a movement."" With the emergence of the Tea Party, he said, ""everyone suddenly sees that for the first time there
are Indians out there—people who can provide real ideological power."" The Kochs, he said, are ""trying to shape and control and
channel the populist uprising into their own policies.""-
A Republican campaign consultant who has done research on behalf of Charles and David Koch said of the Tea Party, ""The
Koch brothers gave the money that founded it. It's like they put the seeds in the ground. Then the rainstorm comes, and the
frogs come out of the mud—and they're our candidates!""
The Kochs and their political operatives declined requests for interviews. Instead, a prominent New York public-relations
executive who is close with the Kochs put forward two friends: George Pataki, the former governor of New York, and Mortimer
Zuckerman, the publisher and real-estate magnate. Pataki, a Republican who received campaign donations from David Koch,
called him ""a patriot who cares deeply about his country."" Zuckerman praised David's ""gentle decency"" and the ""range of his
public interests.""
The Republican campaign consultant said of the family's political activities, ""To call them under the radar is an
understatement. They are underground!"" Another former Koch adviser said, ""They're smart. This right-wing, redneck stuff
works for them. They see this as a way to get things done without getting dirty themselves."" Rob Stein, a Democratic political

strategist who has studied the conservative movement's finances, said that the Kochs are ""at the epicenter of the anti-Obama
movement. But it's not just about Obama. They would have done the same to Hillary Clinton. They did the same with Bill •
Clinton. They are out to destroy progressivism.""
ddly enough, the fiercely capitalist Koch family owes part of its fortune to Joseph Stalin. Fred Koch was the son of a Dutch
printer who settled in Texas and ran a weekly newspaper. Fred attended M.I.T., where he earned a degree in chemical
engineering. In 1927, he invented a more efficient process for converting oil into gasoline; but, according to family lore,
America's major oil companies regarded him as a threat and shut him out of the industry. Unable to succeed at home, Koch
found work in the Soviet Union. In the nineteen-thirties, his company trained Bolshevik engineers and helped Stalin's regime
set up fifteen modern oil refineries. Over time, however, Stalin brutally purged several of Koch's Soviet colleagues. Koch was
deeply affected by the experience, and regretted his collaboration. He returned to the U.S. In the headquarters of his company,
Rock Island Oil & Refining, in Wichita, he kept photographs aimed at proving that some of those Soviet refineries had been
destroyed in the Second World War. Gus diZerega, a former friend of Charles Koch, recalled, ""As the Soviets became a
stronger military power, Fred felt a certain amount of guilt at having helped build them up. I think it bothered him a lot.""
In 1958, Fred Koch became one of the original members of the john Birch Society, the arch-conservative group known, in
part, for a highly skeptical view of governance and for spreading fears of a Communist takeover. Members considered President
Dwight D. Eisenhower to be a Communist agent. In a self-published broadside, Koch claimed that the Communists have
infiltrated both the Democrat and Republican Parties."" He wrote admiringly of Benito Mussolini's suppression of Communists
in Italy, and disparagingly of the American civil-rights movement. ""The colored man looms large in the Communist plan to take
over America,"" he warned. Welfare was a secret plot to attract rural blacks to cities, where they would foment ""a vicious race
war."" In a 1963 speech that prefigures the Tea Party's talk of a secret 'socialist plot, Koch predicted that Communists would
""infiltrate the highest offices of government in the U.S. until the President is a Communist, unknown to the rest of us.""
Koch married Mary Robinson, the daughter of a Missouri physician, and they had four sons: Freddie, Charles, and twins,
David and William. John Damgard, the president of the Futures Industry Association, was David's schoolmate and friend. He
recalled that Fred Koch was ""a real John Wayne type."" Koch emphasized rugged pursuits, taking his sons big-game hunting in
Africa, and requiring them to do farm labor at the family ranch. The Kochs lived in a stone mansion on a large compound across
from Wichita's country club; in the summer, the boys could hear their friends splashing in the pool, but they were not allowed
to join them. ""By instilling a work ethie in me at an early age, my father did me a big favor, although it didn't seem like a favor
back then,"" Charles has written. ""By the time I was eight, he made sure work occupied most of my spare time."" David Koch
recalled that his father also indoctrinated the boys politically. ""He was constantly speaking to us children about what was wrong
with government,"" he told Brian Doherty, an editor of the libertarian magazine Reason, and the author of ""Radicals for
Capitalism,"" a 2007 history of the libertarian movement. ""It's something I grew up with—a fundamental point of view that big
government was bad, and imposition of government controls on our lives and economic fortunes was not good.""
David attended Deerfield Academy, in Massachusetts, and Charles was sent to military school. Charles, David, and William
all earned engineering degrees at their father's alma mater, M.I.T., and later joined the family company. Charles eventually
assumed control, with David as his deputy; William's career at the company was less successful. Freddie went to Harvard and
studied playwriting at the Yale School of Drama. His father reportedly disapproved of him, and punished him financially.
(Freddie, through a spokesperson, denied this:)
In 1967, after Fred Koch died, of a heart attack, Charles renamed the business Koch Industries, in honor of his father. Fred
Koch's will made his sons extraordinarily wealthy. David Koch joked about his good fortune in a 2003 speech to alumni at
Deerfield, where, after pledging twenty-five million dollars, he was made the school's sole ""lifetime trustee."" He said, ""You
might ask: How does David Koch happen to have the wealth to be so generous? Well, let me tell you a story. It all started when
I was alittle boy. One day, my father gave me an apple. I soon sold it for five dollars and bought two apples and sold them for
ten. Then I bought four apples and sold them for twenty. Well, this went on day after day, week after week, month after month,
year after year, until my father died and left me three hundred million dollars!""
David and Charles had absorbed their father's conservative politics, but they did not share all his views, according to
diZerega, who befriended Charles in the mid-sixties, after meeting him while browsing in a John Birch Society bookstore in

Wichita. Charles eventually invited him to the Kochs' mansion, to participate in an informal political-discussion group. ""It was
pretty clear that Charles thought some of the Birch Society was bullshit,"" diZerega recalled.
DiZerega, who has lost touch with Charles, eventually abandOned right-wing views, and became a political-science
professor. He credits Charles with opening his mind to political philosophy, which set him on the path to academia; Charles is
one of three people to whom he dedicated his first book. But diZerega believes that the Koch brothers have followed a wayward
intellectual trajectory, transferring their father's paranoia about Soviet Communism to a distrust of the U.S. government, and
seeing its expansion, beginning with the New Deal, as a tyrannical threat to freedom. In an essay, posted on Beliefnet, diZerega
writes, ""As state socialism failed ... the target for many within these organizations shifted to any kind of regulation at all.
'Socialism' kept. being defined downwards.""
Members of the. John Birch Society developed.an interest in a school of Austrian economists who promoted free-market
ideals. Charles and David Koch were particularly influenced by the work of Friedrich von Hayek, the author of ""The Road to
Serfdom"" (1944), which argued that centralized government planning led, inexorably, to totalitarianism. Hayek'S belief in
unfettered capitalism has proved inspirational to many conservatives, and to anti-Soviet dissidents; lately, Tea Party supporters
have championed his work. In June, the talk-radio host Glenn Beck, who has supported the Tea Party rebellion, promoted ""The
Road to Serfdom"" on his show; the paperback soon became a No. 1 best-seller on Amazon. (Beck appears to be a fan of the
Kochs; in the midst of arecent on-air parody of Al Gore, Beck said, without explanation, ""I want to thank Charles Koch for this
information."" Beck declined to elaborate on the relationship.)
Charles and David also became devotees of a more radical thinker, Robert LeFevre, who favored the abolition of the state
but didn't like the label ""anarchist""; he called himself an ""autarchist."" LeFevre liked to say that ""government is a disease
masquerading as its own cure."" In 1956, he opened an institution called the Freedom School, in Colorado Springs. Brian
Doherty, of Reason, told me that ""LeFevre was an anarchist figure who won Charles's heart,"" and that the school was ""a tiny
world of people who thought the New Deal was a horrible mistake."" According to diZerega, Charles supported the school
financially, and even gave him money to take classes there.
Throughout the seventies, Charles and David continued to build Koch Industries. In 1980, William, with assistance from
Freddie, attempted to take over the company from Charles, who, they felt, had assumed autocratic control. In retaliation, the
company's board, which answered to Charles, fired William. (""Charles runs it all with an iron hand,"" Bruce Bartlett, the
economist, told me.) Lawsuits were filed, with William and Freddie on one side and Charles and David on the other. In 1983,
Charles and David bought out their brothers' share in the company for nearly a billion dollars. But the antagonism remained,
and litigation continued for seventeen more years, with the brothers hiring rival private investigators; in 1990, they walked past
one another with stony expressions at their mother's funeral. Eventually. Freddie moved to Monaco, which has no income tax.
He bought historic, estates in France. Austria, and elsewhere, filling them with art, antiques, opera scores, and literary
manuscripts. William founded his own energy company, Oxbow, and turned to yachting; he spent an estimated sixty-five
million dollars to win the America's Cup, in 1992.
With Charles as the undisputed chairman and C.E.O., Koch Industries expanded rapidly. Roger Altman, who heads the
investment-banking firm Evercore, told me that the company's performance has been ""beyond phenomenal."" Charles remained
in Wichita, with his wife and two children, guarding his privacy while supporting community charities. David moved to New
York City, where he is an executive vice-president of the company and the C.E.O. of its Chemical Technology Group. A
financial expert who knows Koch Industries well told me, ""Charles is the company. Charles runs it."" David, described by
associates as ""affable"" and ""a bit of a lunk,"" enjoyed for years the life of a wealthy bachelor. He rented a yacht in the South of
France and bought a waterfront home in Southampton, where he threw parties that the Web site New York Social Diary likened
to an ""East Coast version of Hugh Hefher's soirees."" In 1996, he married Julia Flesher, a fashion assistant. They live in a nine-
thousand-square-foot duplex at 740 Park Avenue, with their three children. Though David's manner is more cosmopolitan, and
more genial, than that of Charles, Brian Doherty, who has interviewed both brothers, couldn't think of a single issue on which
the brothers disagreed.
As their fortunes grew, Charles and David Koch became the primary underwriters of hard-line libertarian politics in
America. Charles's goal, as Doherty described it, was to tear the government ""out at the root."" The brothers' first major public

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015
step came in 1979, when Charles persuaded David, then thirty-nine, to run for public office. They had become supporters of the
Libertarian Party, and were backing its Presidential candidate, Ed Clark, who was running against Ronald Reagan from the
right. Frustrated by the legal limits on campaign donations, they contrived to place David on the ticket, in the Vice-Presidential
slot; upon becoming a candidate, he could lavish as much of his personal fortune as he wished on the campaign. The ticket's
slogan was ""The Libertarian Party has only one source of funds: You."" In fact, its primary source of funds was David Koch,
who spent more than two million dollars on the effort.
Many of the ideas propounded in the 1980 campaign presaged the Tea Party movement. Ed Clark told The Nation that
libertarians were getting ready to stage ""a very big tea party,"" because people were ""sick to death"" of taxes. The Libertarian
Party platform called for the abolition of the F.B.I. and the C.I.A., as well as of federal regulatory agencies, such as the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Energy. The Party wanted to end Social Security, minimum-wage
laws, gun control, and all personal and corporate income taxes; it proposed the legalization of prostitution, recreational drugs,
and suicide. Government should be reduced to only one function: the protection of individual rights. William F. Buckley, Jr., a
more traditional conservative, called the movement ""Anarcho-Totalitarianism.""
That November, the Libertarian ticket received only one per cent of the vote. The brothers realized that their brand of
politics didn't sell at the ballot box. Charles Koch became openly scornful of conventional politics. ""It tends to be a nasty,
corrupting business,"" he told a reporter at the time. ""I'm interested in advancing libertarian ideas."" According to Doherty's
book, the .Kochs came to regard elected politicians as merely ""actors playing out a script."" A longtime confidant of the Kochs
told Doherty that the brothers wanted to ""supply the themes and words for the scripts."" In order to alter the direction of
America, they had to ""influence the areas where policy ideas percolate from: academia. and think tanks.""
fter the 1980 election, Charles and David Koch receded from the public arena. But they poured more than a hundred million
. dollars into dozens of seemingly independent organizations. Tax records indicate that in 2008 the three main Koch family
foundations gave money.to thirty-four political and policy organizations, three of which they founded, and several of which
they direct. The Kochs and their company have given additional millions to political campaigns, advocacy groups, and
lobbyists. The family's subterranean financial role has fuelled suspicion on the left: Lee Fang, of the liberal blog ThinkProgress,
has called the Kochs the billionaires behind the hate.""
Only the Kochs know precisely how much they have spent on politics. Public tax records show that between 1998 and 2008
the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation spent more than forty-eight million dollars. The Claude R. Lambe Charitable
Foundation, which is controlled by Charles Koch and his wife, along with two company employees and an accountant, spent
more than twenty-eight million. The David H. Koch Charitable Foundation spent more than a hundred and twenty million.
Meanwhile, since 1998 Koch Industries has spent more than fifty million dollars on lobbying. Separately, the company's
political-action committee, KochPAC, has donated some eight million dollars to political campaigns, more than eighty
per cent of it to Republicans. So far in 2010, Koch Industries leads all other energy companies in political
contributions, as it has since 2006. In addition, during the past dozen years the Kochs and other family members
have personally spent more than two million dollars on political contributions. In the second quarter of 2010, David
Koch was the biggest individual contributor to the Republican Governors Association, with a million-dollar donation.
Other gifts by the Kochs may be untraceable; federal tax law permits anonymous personal donations to politically
active nonprofit groups.
In recent decades, members of several industrial dynasties have spent parts of their fortunes on a conservative agenda. In
the nineteen-eighties, the Olin family, which owns a chemicals-and-manufacturing conglomerate, became known for funding
right-leaning thinking in academia, particularly in law schools. And during the nineties Richard Mellon Scaife, a descendant of
Andrew Mellon, spent millions attempting to discredit President Bill Clinton. An Rabin-Havt, a vice-president at the
Democratic-leaning Web site Media Matters, said that the Kochs' effort is Unusual, in its marshalling of corporate and personal
funds: ""Their role, in terms of financial commitments, is staggering.""
Of course, Democrats give money, too. Their most prominent donor, the financier George Soros, runs a foundation, the
Open Society Institute, that has spent as much as a hundred million dollars a year in America. Soros has also made generous
private contributions to various Democratic campaigns, including Obama's. But Michael Vachon, his spokesman, argued that
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015
Soros's giving is transparent, and that ""none of his contributions are in the service of his own economic interests."" The Kochs
have given millions of dollars to nonprofit groups that criticize environmental regulation and support lower taxes for industry.
Gus diZerega, the former friend, suggested that the Kochs' youthful idealism about libertarianism had largely devolved into a
rationale for corporate self-interest. He said of Charles, ""Perhaps he has confused making money with freedom.""
Some critics have suggested that the Kochs' approach has subverted the purpose of tax-exempt giving. By law, charitable
foundations must conduct exclusively nonpartisan activities that promote the public welfare. A 2004 report by the National
Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, a watchdog group, described the Kochs' foundations as being self-serving,
concluding, ""These foundations give money to nonprofit organizations that do research and advocacy on issues that impact the
profit margin of Koch Industries.""
The Kochs have gone well beyond their immediate self-interest, however, funding organizations that aim to push the
country in a libertarian. direction. Among the institutions that they have subsidized are the Institute for Justice, which files.
lawsuits opposing state and federal regulations; the Institute for Humane Studies, which underwrites libertarian academics; and
the Bill of Rights Institute, which promotes a conservative slant on the Constitution. Many of the organizations funded by the
Kochs employ specialists who write position Papers that are subsequently quoted by politicians and pundits. David Koch has
acknowledged that the family exerts tight ideological control. ""If we're going to give a lot of money, we'll make darn sure they •
spend it in a way that goes along with our intent,"" he told Doherty. ""And if they make a wrong turn and start doing things we
don't agree with, we withdraw funding.""
he Kochs' subsidization of a pro-corporate movement fulfills, in many ways, the vision laid out in a secret 1971 memo that
Lewis Powell. then a Virginia attorney, wrote two months before he was nominated to the Supreme Court. The antiwar
movement had turned its anger on defense contractors, such as Dow Chemical, and Ralph Nader was leading a public-interest
crusade against corporations. Powell, writing a report for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, urged American companies to fight
back. The greatest threat to free enterprise, he warned, was not Communism or the New Left but, rather, ""respectable elements
of society""—intellectuals, journalists, and scientists. To defeat them, he wrote, business leaders needed to wage a long-term,
• unified campaign to change public opinion.
Charles Koch seems to have approached both business and politics with the deliberation of an engineer. ""To bring about
social change,"" he told Doherty, requires ""a strategy"" that is ""vertically and horizontally integrated,"" spanning ""from idea
creation to policy development to education to grassroots organizations to lobbying to litigation to political action."" The project,
he admitted, was extremely ambitious. ""We have a radical philosophy,"" he said.
In 1977, the Kochs provided the funds to launch the nation"						
s first libertarian think tank	 the Cato Institute. According to the								
'Center for Public Integrity	 between 1986 and 1993 the Koch family gave eleven million dollars to the institute. Today Cato								
has more than a hundred full-time employees	 and its experts and policy papers are widely quoted and respected by the								
mainstream media. It describes itself as nonpartisan	 and its scholars have at times been critical of both parties. But it has								
consistently pushed for corporate tax cuts	 reductions in social services	 and laissez-faire environmental policies.							
When President Obama	 in a 2008 speech	 described the science on global warming as ""beyond dispute	 the Cato Institute						
took out a full-page ad in the Times to contradict him. Cato's resident scholars have relentlessly criticized political attempts to									
stop global warming as expensive	 ineffective	 and unnecessary. Ed Crane	 the Cato Institute's founder and president	 told me					
that ""global-warming theories give the government more control of the economy.""									
Cato scholars have been particularly energetic in promoting the Climategate scandal. Last year	 private e-mails of climate								
scientists at the University of East Anglia	 in England	 were mysteriously leaked	 and their exchanges appeared to suggest a						
willingness to falsify data in order to buttress the idea that global warming is real. In the two weeks after the e-mails went									
public	 one Cato scholar gave more than twenty media interviews trumpeting the alleged scandal. But five independent inquiries								
have since exonerated the researchers	 and nothing was found in their e-mails or data to discredit the scientific consensus on								
global warming. •									
Nevertheless	 the controversy succeeded in spreading skepticism about climate change. Even though the National Oceanic								
and Atmospheric Administration recently issued a report concluding that the evidence for global warming is unequivocal	 more								
Americans are convinced than at any time since 1997 that scientists have exaggerated the seriousness of global warming. The

Kochs promote this statistic on their company's Web site but do not mention the role that their funding has played in fostering									
such doubt.									
In a 2002 memo	 the Republican political consultant Frank Luntz wrote that so long as ""voters believe there is no consensus								
about global warming within the scientific community' the status quo would prevail. The key for opponents of environmental									
reform	 he said	 was to question the science—a public-relations strategy that the tobacco industry used effectively for years to							
forestall regulation. The Kochs have funded many sources of environmental skepticism	 such as the Heritage Foundation	 which							
has argued that ""scientific facts gathered in the past 10 years do not support the notion of catastrophic human-made warming.""									
The brothers have given money to more obscure groups	 too	 such as the Independent Women's Forum	 which opposes the						
presentation of global warming as a scientific fact in American public schools. Until 2008	 the group was run by Nancy								
Pfotenhauer	 a former lobbyist for Koch Industries. Mary Beth Jarvis	 a vice-president of a Koch subsidiary	 is on the group's						
board.									
Naomi Oreskes	 a professor of history and science studies at the University of California	 San Diego	 is the co-author of						
Merchants of Doubt	 a new book that chronicles various attempts by American industry to manipulate public opinion on								
science. She noted that the Kochs	 as the heads of ""a company with refineries and pipelines	 have ""a lot at stake."" She added							
If the answer is to phase out fossil fuels	 a different group of people are going to be making money	 so we shouldn't be							
surprised that they're fighting tooth and nail.""									
David Koch told New York that he was unconvinced that global warming has been caused by human activity. Even if it has									
been	 he said	 the heating of the planet will be beneficial	 resulting in longer growing seasons in the Northern Hemisphere. ""The						
Earth will be able to support enormously more people because far greater land area will be available to produce food	 he said.								
n the mid-eighties	 the Kochs provided millions of dollars to George Mason University	 in Arlington	 Virginia	 to set up another					
think tank. Now known as the Mercatus Center	 it promotes itself as ""the world's premier university source for market-oriented								
ideas—bridging the gap between academic ideas and real-world problems."" Financial records show that the Koch family									
foundations have contributed more than thirty million dollar's to George Mason	 much of which has gone to the Mercatus								
Center	 a nonprofit organization. ""It's ground zero for deregulation policy in Washington	 Rob Stein	 the Democratic strategist						
said. It is an unusual arrangement. ""George Mason is a public university	 and receives public funds	 Stein noted. ""Virginia is							
hosting an institution that the Kochs practically control.""									
The founder of the Mercatus Center is Richard Fink	 formerly an economist. Fink heads Koch Industries' lobbying								
operation in Washington. In addition	 he is the president of the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation	 the president of the							
Claude R. Lambe Charitable Foundation	 a director of the Fred C. and Mary R. Koch Foundation	 and a director and co-							
founder	 with David Koch	 of the Americans for Prosperity Foundation.							
Fink	 with his many titles	 has become the central nervous system of the Kochtopus. He appears to have supplanted Ed							
Crane	 the head of the Cato Institute	 as the brothers' main political lieutenant. Though David remains on the board at Cato							
Charles Koch has fallen out with Crane. Associates suggested to me that Crane had been insufficiently respectful of Charles's									
management philosophy	 which he distilled into a book called ""The Science of Success	 and trademarked under the name							
Market-Based Management	 or M.B.M. In the book. Charles recommends instilling a company's corporate culture with the								
competitiveness of the marketplace.. Koch describes M.B.M. as a ""holistic system"" containing ""five dimensions: vision	 virtue								
and talents	 knowledge processes	 decision rights and incentives."" A top Cato Institute official told me that Charles ""thinks he's							
a genius. He's the emperor	 and he's convinced he's wearing clothes."" Fink	 by contrast	 has been far more embracing of						
Charles's ideas. (Fink	 like the Kochs	 declined to. be interviewed.)							
At a 1995 conference for philanthropfsts	 Fink adopted the language of economics when speaking about the Mercatus								
Center's purpose. He said that grant-makers should use think tanks and political-action groups to convert intellectual raw									
materials into policy ""products.""									
The Wall Street Journal has called the Mercatus Center ""the most important think tank you've never heard of	 and noted								
that fourteen of the twenty-three regulations that President George W. Bush placed on a ""hit list"" had been suggested first by									
Mercatus scholars. Fink told the paper that the Kochs have ""other means of fighting [their] battles	 and that the Mercatus								
Center does riot actively promote the company's private interests. But Thomas McGarity	 a law professor at the University of

Texas	 who specializes in environmental issues	 told me that ""Koch has been constantly in trouble with the E.P.A.	 and						
Mercatus has constantly hammered on the agency."" An environmental lawyer who has clashed with the Mercatus Center called									
it ""a means of laundering economic aims."" The lawyer explained the strategy: ""You take corporate money and give it to a									
neutral-sounding think tank	 which ""hires people with pedigrees and academic degrees who put out credible-seeming studies.								
But they all coincide perfectly with the economic interests of their funders.""									
In 1997	 for instance	 the E.P.A. moved to reduce surface ozone	 a form of pollution caused	 in part	 by emissions from oil				
refineries. Susan Dudley	 an economist who became a top official at the 'Mercatus Center	 criticized the proposed rule. The							
E.P.A.	 she argued	 had not taken into account that smog-free skies would result in more cases of skin cancer. She projected that							
if pollution were controlled it would cause up to eleven thousand additional cases of skin cancer each year.									
In 1999	 the District of Columbia Circuit Court took 'up Dudley's smog argument. Evaluating the E.P.A. rule	 the court							
found that the E.P.A. had ""explicitly disregarded"" the ""possible health benefits of ozone."" In another part of the opinion	 the								
court ruled	 2-1	 that the E.P.A. had overstepped its authority in calibrating standards for ozone emissions. As the Constitutional							
Accountability Center	 a think tank	 revealed	 the judges in the majority had previously attended legal junkets	 on a Montana					
ranch	 that were arranged by the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment—a group funded by Koch family								
foundations. The judges have claimed that the ruling was unaffected by their attendance.									
deas don't happen on their own	 Matt Kibbe	 the president of Freedom Works	 a Tea Party advocacy group	 told me.					
Throughout history	 ideas need patrons."" The Koch brothers	 after helping to create Cato and Mercatus	 concluded that think						
tanks alone were not enough to effect change. They needed a mechanism to deliver those ideas to the street	 and to attract the								
public's support. in 1984	 David Koch and Richard Fink created yet another organization. and Kibbe joined them. The group								
Citizens for a Sound Economy	 seemed like a grassroots movement	 but according to the Center for Public Integrity it was							
sponsored principally by the Kochs	 who provided $7.9 million between 1986 and 19.93. Its mission	 Kibbe said	 ""was to take						
these heavy ideas and translate them for mass America.... We read the same literature Obama did about nonviolent									
revolutions--Saul _Minsky	 Gandhi	 Martin Luther King. We studied the idea of the Boston Tea Party as an example of							
nonviolent social change. We learned we needed boots on the ground to sell ideas	 not candidates."" Within a few years	 the							
group had mobilized fifty paid field workers	 in twenty-six states	 to rally voters behind the Kochs' agenda. David and Charles							
according to one participant	 were ""very controlling	 very top down. You can't build an organization with them. They run it.""							
Around this time	 the brothers faced a political crisis. In 1989	 the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs investigated							
their business and released a scathing report accusing Koch Oil of ""a widespread and sophisticated scheme to steal crude oil									
from Indians and others through fraudulent mismeasuring."" The Kochs admitted that they had improperly taken thirty-one									
million dollars' worth of crude oil	 but said that it had been accidental. Charles Koch told committee investigators that oil								
measurement is ""a very uncertain art.""									
To defend its reputation	 Koch IndustrieS hired Robert Strauss	 then a premier Washington lobbyist; the company soon							
opened an office in the city. A grand jury was convened to investigate the allegations	 but it eventually disbanded	 without							
issuing criminal charges. According to the Senate report	 after the committee hearings Koch operatives delved into the personal								
lives of committee staffers	 even questioning an ex-wife. Senate investigators were upset by the Kochs' tactics. Kenneth Batten								
the counsel to the Senate committee	 said	 ""These people have amassed such unaccountable power!'							
.'									
By •1993	 when Bill Clinton became President	 Citizens for a Sound Economy had become a prototype for the kind of							
corporate-backed opposition campaigns that have proliferated during the Obama era. The group waged a successful assault on									
Clinton's proposed B.T.U. tax on energy	 for instance	 running advertisements	 staging media events	 and targeting opponents.					
And it mobilized anti-tax rallies outside the Capitol—rallies that NPR described as ""designed to strike fear into the hearts of									
wavering Democrats."" Dan Glickman	 a former Democratic congressman from Wichita	 who supported the B.I.U. tax	 recalled						
I'd been in Congress eighteen years. The Kochs actually engaged against me and funded my opponent. They used a lot of									
'resources and effort—their employees	 too."" Glickman suffered a surprise defeat. ""I can't prove it	 but I think I was probably							
their victim	 he said.								
The Kochs continued to disperse their money	 creating slippery organizations with generic-sounding names	 and this made							
it difficult to ascertain the extent of their influence in Washington. In 1990	 Citizens for a Sound Economy created a spinoff								
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015									

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015									
group	 Citizens for the Environment	 which called acid rain and other environmental problems ""myths."" When the							
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette investigated the matter	 it discovered that the spinoff group had ""no citizen membership of its own.""								
In 1997	 another Senate investigation began looking into what a minority report called ""an audacious plan to pour millions								
of dollars in contributions into Republican campaigns nationwide without disclosing the amount or source	 in order to evade								
campaign-finance laws. A shell corporation	 Triad Management	 had paid more than three million dollars for attack ads in							
twenty-six House races and three Senate races. More than half of the advertising money came from an obscure nonprofit group									
the Economic Education Trust. The Senate committee's minority report suggested that ""the trust was financed in whole or in									
part by Charles and David Koch of Wichita	 Kansas."" The brothers were suspected of having secretly paid for the attack ads								
most of which aired in states where Koch Industries did business. In Kansas	 where Triad Management was especially active								
the funds may have played a decisive role in four of six federal races. The Kochs	 when asked by reporters if they had given the								
money	 refused to comment. In i998	 however	 the Wall Street Journal confirmed that a consultant on the Kochs' payroll had						
been involved in the scheme. Charles Lewis	 of the Center for Public Integrity	 described the scandal as ""historic. Triad was the							
first time a major corporation used a cutout""—a front operation—""in a threatening way. Koch Industries was the poster child of									
a company run amok.""									
uring the Clinton Administration	 the energy industry faced increased scrutiny and regulation. In the mid-nineties	 the Justice							
Department filed two lawsuits against Koch Industries	 claiming that it was responsible for more than three hundred oil spills								
which had released an estimated three million gallons of oil into lakes and rivers. The penalty was potentially as high as two									
hundred and fourteen million dollars. In a settlement. Koch Industries paid a record thirty-million-dollar civil fine	 and agreed to								
spend five million dollars on environmental projects.									
In 1999	 a jury found Koch Industries guilty of negligence and malice in the deaths of two Texas teen-agers in an explosion								
that resulted from a leaky underground butane pipeline. (In 2001	 the company paid an undisclosed settlement.) And in the final								
months of the Clinton Presidency the Justice Department levelled a ninety-seven-count indictment against the company	 for								
covering up the discharge of ninety-one tons of benzene	 a carcinogen	 from its refinery in Corpus Christi	 Texas. The company						
was liable •for three hundred and fifty million dollars in fines	 and four Koch employees faced up to thirty-five years in prison.								
The Koch Petroleum Group eventually pleaded guilty to one criminal charge of covering up environmental violations	 including								
the falsification of documents	 and paid a twenty-million-dollar fine. David Uhlmann	 a career prosecutor who	 at the time						
headed the environmental-crimes section at the Justice Department	 described the suit as ""one of the most significant cases ever								
brought under the Clean Air Act."" He added	 ""Environmental crimes are almost always motivated by economics and arrogance								
and in the Koch case there was a healthy dose of both.""									
During the 2000 election campaign	 Koch Industries spent some nine hundred thousand dollars to support the candidacies								
of George W. Bush and other Republicans. During the Bush years	 Koch Industries and other fossil-fuel companies enjoyed								
remarkable prosperity. The 2005 energy bill	 which Hillary Clinton dubbed the Dick Cheney Lobbyist Energy Bill	 offered							
enormous subsidies and tax breaks for energy companies. The Kochs have cast themselves as deficit hawks	 but	 according to a							
study by Media Matters	 their companies have benefitted from nearly a hundred million dollars in government contracts since								
2000									
In 2004	 Citizens for a Sound Economy was accused of illegitimately throwing its weight behind Bush's reelection. The								
group's Oregon branch had attempted to get Ralph Nader on the Presidential ballot	 in order to dilute Democratic support for								
John Kerry. Critics argued that it was illegal	 for a tax-exempt nonprofit organization to donate its services for partisan political								
purposes. (A complaint was filed with the Federal Election Commission; it was dismissed.)									
That year	 internal rivalries at Citizens for a Sound Economy caused the organization to split apart. David Koch and Fink								
started a new group	 Americans for Prosperity	 and they hired Tim Phillips to run it. Phillips was a political veteran who had							
worked with Ralph Reed	 the evangelical leader and Republican activist	 co-founding Century Strategies	 a campaign-						
consulting company that became notorious for its ties to the disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff. Phillips's online biography									
describes him as an expert in ""grasstops"" and ""grassroots"" political organizing. The Kochs' choice of Phillips signalled an even									
greater toughness. The conservative operative Grover Norquist	 who is known for praising ""throat slitters"" in politics	 called							
Phillips ""a grownup who can make things happen.""									
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015									

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015									
Last year	 Phillips told the Financial Times that Americans for Prosperity had only eight thousand registered members.								
Currently	 its Web site claims that the group has ""1.2 million activists."" Whatever its size	 the Kochs' political involvement has							
been intense; a former employee of the Cato Institute told me that Americans for Prosperity ""was micromanaged by the Kochs.""									
And the brothers' investment may well have paid off: Americans for Prosperity	 in concert with the family's other								
organizations	 has been instrumental in disrupting the Obama Presidency.								
In January	2008	 Charles Koch wrote in his company newsletter that America could be on the verge of ""the greatest loss of							
liberty and prosperity since the 1930s."" That October	 Americans for Prosperity held a conference of conservative operatives at								
a Marriott hotel outside Washington. Erick Erickson	 the editor-in-chief of the conservative blog RedState.com	 took the lectern							
thanked David Koch	 and vowed to ""unite and fiaht ... the armies of the left!"" Sodn after Obama assumed office	 Americans							
for Prosperity launched ""Porkulus"" rallies against Obama's stimulus-spending measures. Then the Mercatus Center released a									
report claiming that stimulus funds had been directed disproportionately toward Democratic districts; eventually	 the author was								
forced to correct the report	 but not before Rush Limbaugh	 citing.the paper	 had labelled Obama's program ""a slush fund	 and					
Fox News and other conservative outlets had echoed the sentiment. (Phil Kerpen	 the vice-president for policy at Americans for								
Prosperity	 is a contributor to the Fox News Web site. Another officer at Americans for Prosperity	 Walter Williams	 often						
guest-hosts for Limbaugh.)									
Americans for Prosperity also created an offshoot	 Patients United Now	 which organized what Phillips has estimated to be							
more than three hundred rallies against health-care reform. Atone rally	 an effigy of a Democratic congressman was hung; at								
another	 protesters unfurled a banner depicting corpses from Dachau. The group also helped organize the ""Kill the Bill"" protests								
outside the Capitol	 in March	 where Democratic supporters of health-care reform alleged that they were spat on and cursed at.							
Phillips was a featured speaker.									
Americans for Prosperity has held at least eighty events targeting cap-and-trade legislation	 which is aimed at making								
industries pay for the air pollution that they create. Speakers for the group claimed	 with exaggeration	 that even back-yard							
barbecues and kitchen stoves would be taxed. The group was also involved in the attacks on Obama's ""green jobs"" czar	 Van								
Jones	 and waged a crusade against international climate talks. Casting	 his group as a champion of ordinary workers who would							
be hurt by environmentalists	 Phillips went to Copenhagen last year and staged a protest outside the United Nations conference								
on climate change	 declaring	 ""We're a grassroots organization.... 1 think it's unfortunate when wealthy children of wealthy							
families . want to send unemployment rates in the United States up to twenty per cent.""									
Grover Norquist	 who holds a weekly meeting for conservative leaders in Washington	 including representatives from							
Americans for Prosperity	 told me that last summer's raucous rallies were pivotal in undermining Obama's agenda. The								
Republican leadership in Congress	 he said	 ""couldn't have clone it without August	 when people went out on the streets. It						
discouraged deal-makers""—Republicans who might otherwise have worked constructively with Obama. Moreover	 the								
appearance of growing public opposition to Obama affected corporate donors on K Street. ""K Street is a three-billion-dollar									
weathervane	 Norquist said. ""When Obama was strong	 the Chamber of Commerce said	 'We can work with the Obama						
Administration.' But that changed when thousands of people went into the street and 'terrorized' congressmen. August is what									
changed it. Now that Obama is weak	 people are getting tough.""								
As the first anniversary of Obama's election approached	 David Koch came to the Washington area to attend a triumphant								
Americans for Prosperity gathering. Obama's poll numbers were falling fast. Not .a single Republican senator was working with									
the Administration on health care	 or much else. Pundits were writing about Obama's political ineptitude	 and Tea Party groups							
were accusing the President of initiating ""a government takeover."" In a speech	 Koch said	 ""Days like today bring to reality the							
vision of our board of directors when we started this organization	 five years ago."" He went on	 ""We envisioned a mass							
movement	 a state-based one	 but national in scope	 of hundreds of thousands of American citizens from all walks of life						
standing up and fighting for the economic freedoms that made our nation the most prosperous society in history.... Thankfully									
the stirrings from California to Virginia	 and from Texas to Michigan	 show that more and more of our fellow-citizens are							
beginning to see the same truths as we do."" .									
While Koch didn't explicitly embrace the Tea Party movement that day	 more recently he has come close to doing so								
praising it for demonstrating the ""powerful visceral hostility in the body politic against the massive increase in government

power	 the massive efforts to socialize this country."" Charles Koch	 in a newsletter sent to his seventy thousand employees							
compared the Obama Administration to the regime of the Venezuelan strongman Hugo Chavez. The Kochs' sense of									
imperilment is somewhat puzzling. Income inequality in America is greater than it has been since the nineteen-twenties	 and								
since the seventies the tax rates of the wealthiest have fallen more than those of the middle class. Yet the brothers' message has									
evidently resonated with voters: a recent poll found that fifty-five per cent of Americans agreed that Obama is a socialist.									
Americans for Prosperity	 meanwhile	 has announced that it will spend an additional forty-five million dollars before the							
midterm elections	 in November. Although the group is legally prohibited from directly endorsing candidates	 it nonetheless							
plans to target some fifty House races and half a dozen Senate races	 staging rallies	 organizing door-to-door canvassing	 and						
running ads aimed at ""educating voters about where candidates stand.""									
Though the Kochs have slowed Obama's momentum	 their larger political battle is far from won. Richard Fink	 interviewed							
by FrumForum.com this spring	 said	 ""If you look at where we've gone from the year 2000 to now	 with the expansion of						
government spending and a debt burden that threatens to bankrupt the country	 it doesn't look very good at all."" He went on	 ""It							
looks like the infrastructure that was built and ruirtitred has not carried the day."" He suggested that the Kochs needed ""to get									
more into the practical	 day-to-day issues of governing.""								
n 1991	 David Koch was badly injured in a plane crash.in Los Angeles. He was the sole passenger in first class to survive. As he								
was recovering	 a routine physical exam led to the discovery of prostate cancer. Koch received treatment	 settled down	 started a						
family	 and reconsidered his life. As he told Portfolio	 ""When you're the only one who survived in the front of the plane and							
everyone.else died—yeah	 you think	 'My God	 the good Lord spared me for some greater purpose.' My joke is that I've been						
busy ever since	 doing all the good work 1 can think of	 so He can have confidence in me.""							
Koch began giving spectacularly large donations to the arts and sciences. And he became a patron of cancer research									
focussing on prostate cancer. In addition to his gifts to Sloan-Kettering	 he gave fifteen million dollars to New York-								
Presbyterian Hospital	 a hundred and twenty-five million to M.I.T. for cancer research	 twenty million to Johns Hopkins							
University	 and twenty-five million to the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center	 in Houston. In response to his generosity	 Sloan-						
Kettering gave Koch its Excellence in Corporate Leadership Award. In 2004	 President Bush named him to the National Cancer								
Advisory Board	 which guides the National.Cancer Institute.								
Koch's corporate and political roles	 however	 may pose conflicts of interest. For example	 at the same time that David						
Koch has been casting himself as a champion in the fight against cancer	 Koch Industries has been lobbying to prevent the								
E.P.A. from classifying formaldehyde	 which the company produces in great quantities	 as a ""known carcinogen"" in humans.							
Scientists have long known that formaldehyde causes cancer in rats	 and several major scientific studies have concluded								
that formaldehyde causes cancer in human beings—including one published last year by the National Cancer Institute	 on								
•whose advisory board Koch sits. The study tracked twenty-five thousand patients for an average of forty years; subjects exposed									
to higher amounts of formaldehyde had significantly higher rates of leukemia. These results helped lead an expert panel within									
the National Institutes of Health to conclude that formaldehyde should be categorized as a known carcinogen	 and be strictly								
controlled by the government. Corporations have resisted regulations on formaldehyde for decades	 however	 and Koch							
Industries has been a large funder of members of Congress who have stymied the E.P.A.	 requiring it to defer new regulations								
until more studies are completed.									
Koch Industries became a major producer of the chemical in 2005	 after it bought Georgia-Pacific	 the paper and wood-							
products company	 for twenty-one billion dollars. Georgia-Pacific manufactures formaldehyde in its chemical division	 and uses							
it to produce various wood products	 such as plywood and laminates. Its annual production capacity for formaldehyde is 2.2								
billion pounds. Last December	 Traylor Champion	 Georgia-Pacific's vice-president of environmental affairs	 sent a formal						
letter of protest to federal health authorities. He wrote that the company ""strongly disagrees"" with the N.I.H. panel's conclusion									
that formaldehyde should be treated as a known human carcinogen. David Koch did not recuse himself from the National									
Cancer Advisory Board	 or divest himself of company stock	 while his company was directly lobbying the government to keep							
formaldehyde on the market. (A board spokesperson said that the issue of formaldehyde had not come up.)									
James Fluff	 an associate director at the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences	 a division of the N.I.H.	 told						
me that it was ""disgusting"" for Koch to be serving on the National Cancer Advisory Board: ""It's just not good for public health.

Vested interests should not be on the board."" He 'went on	 ""Those boards are very important. They're very influential as to								
whether N.C.I. goes into formaldehyde or not. Billions of dollars are involved in formaldehyde.""									
Harold Vannus	 the director of the National Cancer Institute	 knows David Koch from Memorial Sloan-Kettering	 which he						
used to run. He said that	 at Sloan-Kettering	 ""a lot of people who gave to us had large business interests. The one thing we							
wouldn't tolerate in our board members is tobacco."" When told of Koch Industries' stance on formaldehyde	 Varmus said that								
he was ""surprised.""									
he David H. Koch Hall of Human Origins	 at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History	 is a multimedia							
exploration of the theory that mankind evolved in response to climate change. At the main entrance	 viewers are confronted								
with a giant graph charting the Earth's temperature over the past ten million years	 which notes that it is far cooler now than it								
was ten thousand years ago. Overhead	 the text reads	 ""HUMANS EVOLVED IN RESPONSE TO A CHANGING WORLD."" The							
message	 as amplified by the exhibit's Web site	 is that ""key human adaptations evolved in response to							
environmental instability."" Only at the end of the exhibit	 under the headline ""OUR SURVIVAL CHALLENGE	 is it noted							
that levels of carbon dioxide are higher now than they have ever been	 and that they are projected to increase								
dramatically in the next century. No cause is given for this development; no mention is made of any possible role									
played by fossil fuels. The exhibit makes it seem part of a natural continuum. The accompanying text says	 ""During								
the period in which humans evolved	 Earth's temperature and the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere								
fluctuated together."" An interactive game in the exhibit suggests that humans will continue to adapt to climate									
change in the future. People may build ""underground cities;"" developing ""short	 compact bodies"" or ""curved spines								
so that ""moving around in tight spaces will be no problem.""									
Such ideas uncannily echo the Koch message. The company's January newsletter to employees	 for instance	 argueS that							
fluctuations in the earth's climate predate humanity	 and concludes	 ""Since we can't control Mother Nature	 let's figure out						
how to get along with her changes."" Joseph Romm	 a physicist who runs the Web site ClirnateProgress.org	 is infuriated by the							
Smithsonian's presentation. ""The whole exhibit whitewashes the modern climate issue	 he said. ""I think the Kochs wanted to								
be seen as some sort of high-minded company	 associated with the greatest natural-history and science museum in the country.								
But the truth is	 the exhibit is underwritten by big-time polluters	 who are underground .funders of action to stop efforts to deal							
with this threat to humanity. I think the Smithsonian should have drawn the line.""									
Cristian Samper	 the museum's director	 said that the exhibit is not about climate change	 and described Koch as ""one of the						
best donors we've had	 in my tenure here	 because he's very interested in the content	 but completely hands off."" He noted	 ""1.					
don't know all the details.of his involvement in other issues.""									
The Kochs have long depended on the public's not knowing all the details about them. They have been content to operate what									
David Koch has called ""the largest company that you've never heard of."" But with the growing prominence of the Tea Party									
and with increased awareness of the Kochs' ties to the movement	 the brothers may find it harder to deflect scrutiny. Recently								
President °barna took aim at the Kochs' political network. Speaking at a Democratic National Committee fund-raiser	 in								
Austin	 he warned supporters that the Supreme Court's recent ruling in the Citizens United case—which struck down laws								
prohibiting direct Corporate spending on campaigns—had made it even easier for big companies to hide behind ""groups with									
harmless-sounding names like Americans for Prosperity."" Obama said	 ""They don't have to say who	 exactly	 Americans for						
Prosperity are. You don't know if it's a foreign-controlled corporation""—or even	 he added	 ""a big oil company.""

exercises	 held in July 2010 in Cambodia and attended by 26 countries. In October 2010	 hundreds of					
Cambodian and U.S. sailors conducted a joint maritime security and security training exercise in Cambodia							
known as ""Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training Cambodia 2010."" Clinton's trip is also seen as part of							
the U.S. effort to deepen its interests in Southeast Asia ahead of joining the East Asia Summit. During the							
visit	 Secretary Clinton agreed to send U.S. experts to resume negotiations with Cambodia with a view to						
exploring ways to resolve the Cambodian debt issue. She also hinted	 ""The United States would be						
interested in seeing the money spent in Cambodia on improving education or environmental protection							
instead of taking a direct payment.""							
SOUTH CHINA SEA							
ASEAN and China will meet to discuss South China Sea. According to ASEAN secretary general Dr.							
Surin Pitsuwan	 ASEAN and China will launch a working group meeting in December to prepare for a code						
of conduct to resolve the territorial disputes in the South China Sea. The meeting will be held in China. The							
ASEAN foreign ministers are keen to avert military conflict and strengthen confidence in the region. The							
code of conduct will implement the Declaration on Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea	 which was						
signed in 2002 by all ASEAN member states and China. ASEAN and China have been unable to agree on							
implementing modalities for the past eight years.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771369 Date: 08/31/2015							
Cambodia rejects internationalization of South China Sea. Cambodian prime minister Hun Sen recently							
urged all claimants to the South China Sea to use existing mechanisms to resolve the dispute through							
consultations and to fully adhere to the Declaration on Conduct in the South China Sea agreed in 2002. His							
statement is seen as action taken in response to a request from China. Cambodia	 which itself is not a						
claimant	 also urged some countries not to pressure China. In the 2002 declaration	 ASEAN and China					
agreed to create a peaceful	 friendly	 and harmonious environment in the South China Sea with a view to					
promoting peace	 stability	 economic growth	 and prosperity in the region. ASEAN and China differ on				
whether to resolve disputes multilaterally (the ASEAN view) or bilaterally (China's preference).							
China expands naval fleet. Amid disputes with ASEAN members over the South China Sea	 with Japan						
•over the East China Sea (Senkaku and Diaoyu Islands)	 and with Korea related to North Korea's sinking of						
the Cheonan	 China is expanding its fleet of naval surveillance ships. China launched a new high-speed						
inspection ship	 and 36 more are expected to be added. The latest ship—China Marine Surveillance 75—						
would patrol the South China Sea. Beijing dismissed criticism suggesting the additional ships might be							
perceived as aggressive and explained that the ships will be used solely to protect its maritime rights.							
MALAYSIA							
Secretary Clinton to visit Kuala Lumpur. Secretary Clinton will be arriving in Malaysia on November 1.							
This is the first official visit to Malaysia by a U.S. secretary of state in 15 years. The three-day official visit to							
Malaysia	 the longest leg of Clinton's Asia trip	 is a reflection of the strengthening of ties between Malaysia					
and the United States. Secretary Clinton was scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Najib	 but he came						
down with chicken pox on the last day of the ASEAN Summit and related summits in Hanoi	 Vietnam.						
Clinton will meet with Malaysia's foreign minister	 Datuk Seri Anifah Aman. A noteworthy feature of the visit						
will be the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding between the Malaysian Government and the							
United States on Science and Technology Cooperation During a briefing in Washington D.C.	 Assistant						
Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said	 ""Few countries have come as far	 in terms of our bilateral					
relationship	 as the one between the United States and Malaysia."" Malaysia's efforts to strengthen ties are						
resulting in a warm embrace from Washington	 D.C. The Clinton visit was in line with the commitment by						
U.S. president Barack Obama to elevate ties with Malaysia to a higher level during a bilateral meeting with							
Prime Minister Najib at the Nuclear Nonproliferation Summit in April 2010. Since then	 Malaysia has sent						
military doctors and specialists to Afghanistan	 strengthened its nonproliferation regime through passing the						
Security Trade Act	 joined the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade negotiations	 and is working closely with the					
United States on transnational issues such as climate change and counterterrorism.							
By-elections in Sabah and Kelantan. Malaysia's Election Commission (EC) has set November 4	2010						
for two important parliamentary by-elections in Batu Sapi in Sabah and Galas in Kelantan. The elections are							
seen as an important referendum on Prime Minister Najib's leadership	 specifically his reform efforts.						
Najib unveils Budget. Prime Minister Najib unveiled his 2011 budget on October 16	 laying the roadmap for						
the country for the next few years. Among the highlights of the budget are plans to build another six							
highways and a 100-story tower	 implementing a Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) transportation system in Kuala						
Lumpur	 and Rural Basic Infrastructure (RBI) NKRA initiatives such as providing clean and treated water						
electricity	 and roads to improve the living standards of rural communities	 especially those in Sabah and					
Sarawak. The Malaysian government also announced that it has achieved its budget target for the first time							
in three years and announced deficit reductions for 2011.							
Indian prime minister visits Malaysia. As part of his ""Look East"" policy	 Indian prime minister Manmohan						
Singh made a visit to Malaysia on October 26 on his way to the East Asia Summit in Hanoi. He met with							
Prime Minister Najib and discussed issues of economic integration and cooperation in the areas of							
infrastructure development	 railways	 knowledge industries	 energy	 defense	 and greater people-to-people		
exchanges. The visit is expected to culminate in the signing of several pacts and the announcement of the							
conclusion of negotiations over an India-Malaysia Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement							
(CECA) that is expected to conclude early next year.							
Malaysia urged to be firm in corruption fight. While Malaysia remained in the same spot as last year's							
on Transparency International's (TI) yearly corruption scale at 56th position	 its corruption score dropped						
from 4.5 to 4.4. TI's corruption scale ranges from zero (perceived to be highly corrupt) to 10 (thought to							
have little corruption). Malaysia's 2010 target was to reach a score of 4.9. Although Prime Minister Najib							
has pledged to tackle corruption and introduced a series of reform measures	 IT urged Malaysia to be firmer

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771369 Date: 08/31/2015							
in fighting corruption. Paul Low	 president of TI Malaysia	 stated that for Malaysia to achieve its national					
target of high-income and developed nation status by 2020	 it needs to maintain and enhance its						
commitment to fight corruption. Endemic corruption has hampered Malaysia's efforts to attracted much-							
needed foreign investment and has posed significant challenges for the country's overall economic							
development.							
PHILIPPINES							
Philippines in top 10 for gender equality. The World Economic Forum ranked the Philippines 9th among							
nearly 200 countries in gender equality in its 2010 Global Gender Gap Report	 the highest ranking in Asia.						
the Philippines also ranked first on education and health in Asia	 13th on economic participation	 and 17th					
on political empowerment. The report comes amid the debate over the passage of the Reproductive Health							
Bill	 which has been staunchly opposed by the Catholic Church. The report quantifies equality in the areas						
of politics	 education	 employment	 and health. The high ranking illustrates the improved status of Filipino				
women in society. Though discrimination still exists	 more women than men are now enrolled in college						
hold CEO positions at the top corporations	 and practice previously male-dominated positions like law						
medicine	 and engineering in the Philippines.						
Philippines to deepen cooperation with Vietnam. President Aquino will sign four landmark							
memorandums of agreement (MOAs) with Vietnam when he visits the country for the East Asia Summit.							
Aquino's visit is by invitation of Vietnamese president Nguyen Min Triet and is his first visit to an ASEAN							
country after his inauguration. The MOAs will focus on academic cooperation	 defense cooperation	 oil spill					
preparedness and response	 and search and rescue at sea.						
PH"" and ""PHL"" instead of ""RP."" The Department of Foreign Affairs has adopted ""PH"" and ""PHL	 which						
are the initials designated by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)	 as the acronyms for						
the nation. The older ""RP"" is the acronym for Republic of the Philippines and has caused confusion with							
other countries. It is unclear if the names of treaties and government bodies using the initials ""RP"" would							
have to be renamed	 such as the RP-U.S. Visiting Forces Agreement.						
NEW ZEALAND							
Pacific Partners: Washington Seminar. The CSIS study Pacific Partners: The Future of U.S.-New							
Zealand Relations is well under way. On Wednesday October 27	2010	 a U.S.-New Zealand expert					
seminar discussed and debated the first draft of the study. Nearly 30 experts offered their wisdom and							
expertise by giving commentary and feedback. The next review will be held in Wellington	 New Zealand	 on					
22-Nov	 and the study will be finalized in January and published at the U.S.-New Zealand Partnership						
Forum in Christchurch in February 2011. It will lay out a series of research-backed recommendations for							
taking the United States and New Zealand to the next level. Prime Minister John Key and Foreign Minister							
Murray McCully will receive Secretary Clinton on Thursday November 4	2010	 in Wellington for her three-					
day visit and will sign the Wellington Declaration. U.S. assistant secretary of state Kurt Campbell stated that							
the declaration will underline the United States' desire to enhance U.S.-New Zealand cooperation on issues							
ranging from nuclear nonproliferation and climate change to stability in the Pacific Islands.							
John Key attends the East Asia Summit. New Zealand's prime minister	 John Key	 has said the Burmese					
election was a step in the right direction	 but not enough to satisfy New Zealand. Prime Minister Key said he						
would raise the issue with UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon	 who will be at the summit. For New						
Zealand's bid for a seat on the UN Security Council in 2015	 Secretary Ban will also be invited to the Pacific						
Islands Forum to be held in Auckland next year. If he accepts	 he will be the first UN secretary general to						
attend.							
Trade deficit expands. Although New Zealand's exports increased recently	 its strong domestic demand						
and currency caused import growth to rise faster. Increased purchases of cars and machinery contributed to							
the widening of this gap. The expansion of New Zealand's exports by 0.3 percent	 or $2.3 billion	 was the					
first time in four months and was concentrated in milk powder	 butter	 and cheese. Imports have increased					
by 3.6 percent	 or $2.77 billion	 and are led by purchases of vehicles	 machinery	 and equipment.

AUSTRALIA							
Prime Minister Julia Gillard on the move. Prime Minister Gillard was in Hanoi this weekend for the Fourth							
East Asia Summit. Gillard indicated that in addition to the various security	 political	 and economic topics					
that will be discussed	 she would take a strong position regarding upholding basic human rights in Burma.						
Following her trip	 Prime Minister Gillard visited Indonesia and Malaysia and discussed human trafficking						
and asylum seekers. She will also have the opportunity to ask Indonesian president Susilo Bambang							
Yudhoyono for clemency for convicted Australian drug trafficker Schapelle Corby.							
AUSMIN November 8	 2010. U.S. secretary of state Hillary Clinton and U.S. secretary of defense Robert						
Gates will participate in the 14th Australia-U.S. Ministerial (AUSMIN) on November 8	 2010. The AUSMIN is						
taking place after being postponed when Secretary of State Clinton needed to turn around en route to							
Australia due to the earthquake in Haiti in January 2010. Australia's foreign minister Kevin Rudd and							
defense minister Stephen Smith will host the consultations at Government House in Melbourne. This will be							
Secretary Clinton's first visit to Australia. AUSMIN is the premier forum for strengthening Australia-U.S.							
cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region and globally on foreign policy	 defense	 and strategic matters.					
Afghan troops train with Special Forces. Six Afghan troops were flown to Australia to train alongside							
Australia's elite Special Forces. Air Chief Marshal Houston defends the decision but neither confirms nor							
denies reports the men are linked to Afghan warlord Matiullah Khan	 who protects U.S. and Australian						
convoys in the Uruzagan province. This training program is seen as a calculated risk and a tactical decision							
that will be beneficial to security in the long run. Some critics say that the government needs to reveal the							
security process these men underwent before entering the country.							
SINGAPORE							
Indonesian haze plagues Singapore and neighbors. Illegal forest-clearing fires on Indonesia's Sumatra							
Island are sending haze across the Malacca Strait to neighboring Malaysia and Singapore	 causing the						
worst air pollution since 2006. Singapore received a Pollution Standards Index reading of 72/100							
considered to be in the moderate range. Singapore's Environment and Water Resources minister Yaacob							
Ibrahim noted that ASEAN environment ministers may need to conduct another meeting to discuss							
measures to combat the haze generated by uncontrolled forest fires on Sumatra. Environment ministers							
from ASEAN states had met in Brunei on October 13 to discuss national	 subregional	 and regional					
activities dealing with land and forest fires. Ibrahim noted that Singapore was disappointed at the recent							
turn of events and that Indonesia has been reminded several times to take more substantive action when							
tackling the issue of transboundary pollution.							
Deputy prime minister steps down after 17 years. After leading a 24	000-strong home team for 17 years						
Wong Kan Seng	 Singapore's deputy prime minister for home affairs	 announced October 27 that he would					
step down from his post. The Home Affairs Ministry oversees such departments and divisions as the Police							
Force	 the Civil Defense Force	 the Prison Service	 the Internal Security Department	 and the Immigration			
and Checkpoints Authority. Law minister K. Shanmugam	 who was the second home affairs minister	 took					
over from Mr. Wong on November 1	2010						
LAOS							
Laos and Thailand border demarcation. Following a three-year suspension	 bilateral negotiations on						
border demarcation between Laos and Thailand are set to resume in January 2011. Laotian foreign minister							
Thounloun Sisoulit underlined the need for fully demarcated borders	 creating a legacy for future						
generations and avoiding mistrust between the neighbors. Ninety-three percent of Cambodian-Laos borders							
have been officially demarcated.							
Laos needs $15 billion to finance its development projects. In a recent meeting with its donor countries							
Laos presented its national development plan to be implemented from 2011 to 2015. The five-year							
development strategy costs about $15 billion. The proposed sources of funding are as follows: 26 percent							
from foreign assistance	 about 60 percent from foreign direct investment	 10 percent from domestic credit					
and 10 percent from the national government. Donor countries agreed on October 21 to support the

development compact	 seeking $3.9 billion from external aid. The donors' main interests in Laos are						
promotion of equitable future growth and transparency in government's revenues.							
Laos learns socialist modernization from China. The Communist parties of China and Laos cohosted							
the inaugural ""socialist modernization"" seminar titled ""Major Theory and Practice in the Socialist							
Modernization Drive."" China Communist Party member Liu Yunshan underlined the need to ""strike a							
balance among reform	 development	 and stability	 and create a favorable condition for the socialist				
modernization drive. China will continue to uphold the great banner of socialist development with Chinese							
characteristics	 emancipate the mind	 keep pace with the times	 promote sound and fast social and				
economic development	 and open up a new prospect in the socialist construction cause.""						
BRUNEI DARUSSALAM							
Japan offers flood assistance for Brunei. Japan's ambassador to Brunei	 Norike Hirose	 suggested that					
Japan could potentially partner with Brunei to help develop infrastructure and to enforce effective methods							
for flood prevention. Ambassador Hirose noted that Japan had already developed the infrastructure							
necessary to deal with severe flooding	 and that the Bruneian government could consider engaging the						
Japanese government on that level. Japan has developed an advanced rapid-response system and							
provisions for the control of extreme flooding.							
China's Huawei to build broadband network in Brunei. Huawei	 a Chinese telecommunications network						
solutions provider	 announced it had been selected as the exclusive provider for the Brunei Next Generation						
Broadband Network (BNBN) project of Telekom Brunei Berhad. The project is the largest investment of its							
kind ever made by Telekom Brunei Berhad. BNBN will oversee the development of four major areas in							
Brunei.							
MEKONG RIVER							
MRC recommends postponing dam construction. According to a report commissioned by the Mekong							
River Commission (MRC)	 no dam should be built on the main stream of the lower Mekong River for the						
next decade. The report comes weeks after Laos formally notified its neighbors that it wants to build a major							
dam at Xayaboury near the border with Thailand. Weighing the potential risks and economic benefits	 the						
MRC recommended deferring dam construction for the next 10 years. It cited the catastrophic							
consequences for fish stocks that could be caused by the mainstream dams.							
Lower Mekong Initiative addresses climate change effects. On October 30	 Secretary Clinton hosted a						
meeting with her counterparts from Cambodia	 Laos	 Thailand	 and Vietnam to discuss plans fOr the Lower				
Mekong Initiative. They first addressed the potential impact of building dams on the Lower Mekong	 then						
discussed ways to adapt to the effects of a changing climate and agreed to explore sustainable operating							
structures for the region.

the principal bilateral forum between Australia and the United States to discuss and share perspectives and							
approaches on major global and regional political issues and to deepen bilateral security and defense							
cooperation. Annually held in an alternate fashion	 this forum is headed by both nations' defense and						
foreign ministers. This year	 both Secretary Clinton and Secretary Gates will be in Melbourne. Their visit will						
also mark the 25th anniversary of the AUSMIN talks	 launched in 1985	 and 70 years of diplomatic relations					
between Australia and the United States.

it's almost always a mixture of both; they							
acknowledge difficulties but say they will pass; they portray themselves as courageous when flying against							
public opinion; they complain that the news media distort the situation and fuel division; they blame their							
opponents for practicing the politics of destruction and obstruction.							
Talking with Obama and his aides	 it's eerie to hear echoes of Clinton and Bush. Obama says the easy issues						
never make it to him	 only the hard ones; Bush often said the same thing. Obama says our war with terrorists						
will never end in a surrender ceremony; Bush often said the same thing. Obama says he does not want to kick							
problems down the road; Bush often said the same thing. In the days leading up to the 1994 midterm elections							
Clinton mocked Republicans for promising to balance the budget while cutting taxes	 saying	 ""They're not					
serious."" In our conversation	 Obama used some variation of the phrase ""they're not serious"" four times in						
referring to Republican budget plans.							
That is not to say the three men are alike; indeed	 they are vastly different. But putting ideology aside	 Obama at					
times seems to be a cross between his two predecessors. Like Clinton	 he digs into the intellectual						
underpinnings of a policy decision	 studying briefing books and seeking a range of opinions. Some aides						
express frustration that he can leave decisions unresolved for too long. But like Bush	 once he has made a						
decision	 Obama rarely revisits it. And like Bush	 he runs a pretty disciplined operation; he started our interview					
a half-hour ahead of schedule	 just as Bush sometimes did. Clinton	 on the other hand	 still runs on Clinton				
Standard Time. Just a few weeks ago	 he was more than six hours late for a scheduled interview with another						
journalist. One constant among all three: It took Clinton and Bush some time to really grow into the presidency							
until they wore it comfortably.							
As Obama looks to the experiences of Clinton and Reagan	 who both rebounded from midterm debacles to win						
re-election	 the lessons differ. In Reagan's case	 the House was already in Democratic hands	 so during his first				
two years	 he forged coalitions of Republicans and conservative Democrats. After the opposition was						
strengthened in the 1982 elections	 that was no longer viable	 and Reagan began working more with Democratic					
leaders. Clinton likewise changed course after the 1994 elections	 emphasizing more incremental	 piece-by-					
piece change rather than sweeping proposals and pursuing goals like welfare reform and balanced budgets when							
he could agree with Newt Gingrich's new majority.							
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771310 Date: 08/31/2015							

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771310 Date: 08/31/2015							
Clinton	 though	 was more instinctively centrist than Obama is	 and his revival owed much to other factors				
particularly his leadership after the Oklahoma City bombing and his budget standoff with Gingrich during the							
partial government shutdown. Some argue Obama might be better off with at least one Republican chamber so							
he too has a foil as Clinton did. But it is unclear if Obama is as agile a politician as Reagan or Clinton. ""He's no							
Bill Clinton when it comes to having the ability to move and to wiggle	 says Joe Gaylord	 a top Gingrich					
adviser. ""I find rigidity in Obama that comes from his life in liberalism."" Ken Duberstein likewise doubts							
Obama's capacity for adjustment. ""They're much better at the art of campaigning than the art of governing	 he						
said.							
Perhaps the more important historical pattern to consider is this one: The last four presidents who failed to win a							
second term were all challenged in their own party. Lyndon Johnson was driven out of the race in 1968 after							
nearly losing the New Hampshire primary to Eugene McCarthy. Gerald Ford fended off Reagan in 1976 but							
went on to lose the general election to Carter	 who likewise had to beat a primary challenger four years later						
Ted Kennedy	 before falling to Reagan. And George H. W. Bush had to overcome Patrick Buchanan before						
losing to Clinton in 1992.							
So it is a high priority for Obama to prevent any intraparty fight in 2012	 and to date	 despite the fire from the					
left	 no serious challenger appears on the horizon. Putting Hillary Clinton in the cabinet may turn out to be one						
of Obama's smartest moves	 because it not only eliminated her as a would-be challenger	 but it also should					
presumably squelch the will-she-or-won't-she speculation that otherwise would have played out for months.							
(Instead	 the guessing game has her replacing Biden on the ticket	 however fanciful that might be.)					
As the first African-American president	 Obama is more aware than most of the limits of looking back. But he						
also has read enough presidential biographies to know he is not the first to encounter rocky times. ""History							
never precisely repeats itself	 Obama told me. ""But there is a pattern in American presidencies — at least						
modern presidencies. You come in with excitement and fanfare. The other party initially	 having been beaten						
says it wants to cooperate with you. You start implementing your program as you promised during the							
campaign. The other party pushes back very hard. It causes a lot of consternation and drama in Washington.							
People who are already cynical and skeptical about Washington generally look at it and say	 This is the same						
old mess we've seen before. The president's poll numbers drop. And you have to then sort of wrestle back the							
confidence of the people as the programs that you've put in place start bearing fruit.""							
To better understand history	 and his role in it	 Obama invited a group of presidential scholars to dinner in					
May in the living quarters of the White House. Obama was curious about	 among other things	 the Tea Party					
movement. Were there precedents for this sort of backlash against the establishment? What sparked them and							
how did they shape American politics? The historians recalled the Know-Nothings in the 1850s	 the Populists in						
the 1890s and Father Charles Coughlin in the 1930s. ""He listened	 the historian H. W. Brands told me. ""What						
he concluded	 I don't know.""						
Obama's conclusions are still being formed. He has learned that ""Washington is even more broken than we							
thought	 as one aide put it. He has trusted his own judgment as he disregarded advisers who told him to scale						
back health care at various stages. And he has found that his vaunted speaking skills are not enough to change							
the dynamics of governance. ""One of the lessons he has to learn is What is the best form of communication for							
him with the American people	 the historian Doris Kearns Goodwin told me. ""He's so good in front of an						
audience	 and I get the sense that he needs the energy off the audience. And so speaking to television cameras						
doesn't really do that.""							
As we talked in the Oval Office	 Obama acknowledged that the succession of so many costly initiatives						
necessary as they may have been	 wore on the public. ""That accumulation of numbers on the TV screen night in						
and night out in those first six months I think deeply and legitimately troubled people	 he told me. ""They						
started feeling like: Gosh	 here we are tightening our belts	 we're cutting out restaurants	 we're cutting out our

gym membership	 in some cases we're not buying new clothes for the kids. And here we've got these folks in						
Washington who just seem to be printing money and spending it like nobody's business.							
And it reinforced the narrative that the Republicans wanted to promote anyway	 which was Obama is not a						
different kind of Democrat — he's the same old tax-and-spend liberal Democrat.""							
Emanuel told me that the cascading crises in Obama's early days exacted a lasting toll. ""The seeds of his							
political difficulty today were planted in taking those steps	 he said. White House officials largely agree they						
should not have let the health care process drag out while waiting for Republican support that would never							
come. ""It's not what people felt they sent Barack Obama to Washington to do	 to be legislator in chief	 a top					
adviser told me. ""It lent itself to the perception that he wasn't doing anything on the economy."" Plouffe agreed							
that guilt by association with Democratic lawmakers did not help. ""When you swim in those waters	 you're						
going to be affected by that	 he said. ""I do think he's paid a political price	 somewhat	 for having to be tied to				
Congress.""							
Still	 for all the second-guessing	 what you do not hear in the White House is much questioning of the basic					
elements of the program — Obama aides	 liberal and moderate alike	 reject complaints from the right that the					
stimulus did not help the economy or that health care expands government too much	 as well as complaints						
from the left that he should have pushed for a bigger stimulus package or held out for a public health care							
option. ""We asked for more stimulus than we ended up with	 Larry Summers	 the outgoing national economics					
adviser	 told me. ""But we fought as hard as we could	 and I believe we got as much as Congress was ever going					
to give us at that time.""							
And they argue that any mistakes affected things only at the margins. ""There's all this talk in this town — if we							
had done energy before health care	 if we had focused more on small business	 if we had done an Oval on the					
economy instead of Iraq	 we would be doing better	 Dan Pfeiffer	 the communications director	 says. ""I don't			
believe that. We could always do things differently	 and there are plenty of things I wish I had back. But I don't						
know they'd change the overall trend.""							
Melody Barnes	 the president's domestic-policy adviser	 says the biggest problem was that after eight years of					
Bush	 Obama's supporters were very eager to change everything right away. ""The pent-up demand across every						
issue area — around science	 around education	 around health care	 immigration	 you name it — there was a lot			
of desire to finally get these things done	 she told me. ""Every segment of the population had something that						
was very important to them that they really wanted to put over the finish line.""							
Obama is preaching patience in an impatient age. One prominent Democratic lawmaker told me Obama's							
problem is that he is not insecure — he always believes he is the smartest person in any room and never feels							
the sense of panic that makes a good politician run scared all the time	 frenetically wooing lawmakers	 power					
brokers	 adversaries and voters as if the next election were a week away.						
Instead	 what you hear Obama aides talking about is that the system is ""not on the level."" That's a phrase						
commonly used around the West Wing — ""it's not on the level."" By that	 they mean the Republicans	 the news					
media	 the lobbyists	 the whole Washington culture is not serious about solving problems. The challenge	 as				
they see it	 is how to rise above a town that can obsess for a week on whether an obscure Agriculture						
Department official in Georgia should have been fired. At the same time	 as Emanuel told me	 ""We have to play					
the game.""							
As Brands	 the historian	 put it	 ""It'll be really interesting to see if a president who is thinking long term can				
have an impact on a political system that is almost irredeemably short term in its perspective.""							
I'd rather be a really good one-term president than a mediocre two-term president."" So Obama told Diane							
Sawyer of ABC News last January at another low point	 just after the Republican Scott Brown captured the

Massachusetts Senate seat held for decades by Ted Kennedy	 costing Democrats their filibuster-proof control of						
the upper chamber and jeopardizing the president's health care plan.							
It's a good line	 but it's one of those things easier said in the first or second year of a presidency. By the third	 it					
starts to become an actual choice. Forks in the road require a president to decide if he will advance ideas that							
will genuinely change the country even if deeply unpopular or if he will opt instead for a safer route that does							
not put re-election at risk. Obama aides like to argue that he has already demonstrated willingness to put aside							
politics by bailing out the banks and automakers	 decisions that he saw as critical to preventing greater						
economic catastrophe (and that ultimately cost taxpayers far less than initially feared).							
But would he jeopardize re-election absent an immediate crisis? The choice may confront him soon after the							
midterms when his bipartisan fiscal commission reports back by Dec. 1 with plans to tame the national deficit							
with a politically volatile menu of unpalatable options	 like scaling back Medicare and Social Security while						
raising taxes. Obama also anticipates putting immigration reform	 another divisive issue fraught with political						
danger	 back on the table. ""If the question is	 Over the next two years do I take a pass on tough stuff	 he told				
me	 ""the answer is no.""						
Obama's aides say they will most likely set up their re-election campaign around next March	 roughly the same						
as when Bush and Clinton incorporated their incumbent campaign operations. They are more optimistic about							
2012 than they are about 2010	 believing the Tea Party will re-elect Barack Obama by pulling the Republican						
nominee to the right. They doubt Sarah Palmn will run and figure Mitt Romney cannot get the Republican							
nomination because he enacted his own health care program in Massachusetts. If they had to guess today	 some						
in the White House say that Obama will find himself running against Mike Huckabee	 the former Arkansas						
governor.							
With that campaign on the horizon	 Obama asked Pete Rouse and Jim Messina to begin thinking about the next						
phase of his presidency	 not just personnel but also priorities and message. Never mind that Rouse was among						
those who wanted to leave — for years	 he has been saying he wanted out of politics but never says no to						
Obama. Indeed	 when Rouse told colleagues he wanted to leave the White House by the end of this year						
Messina bet him $400 that he would not. ""We'll see what happens	 Rouse told me when I asked about the bet						
last month. Then Obama made Rouse interim chief of staff. Rouse initially resisted moving into Rahm							
Emanuel's corner suite until colleagues threatened to move his files for him. Messina jokes that Rouse will turn							
off the Oval Office lights after eight years and before assuming his new job	 running Obama's presidential						
library.							
Rouse is managing a slow-motion White House shuffle. By year's end	 there will be a new chief of staff	 a new					
national-economics adviser	 a new budget director	 a new chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and a					
new national-security adviser	 among others. Axelrod and Messina expect to leave by spring to set up Obama's						
re-election effort	 and Plouffe will almost certainly come into the White House in a senior role.						
There are a lot of lessons learned in the last two years in terms of how we might improve internal							
communication	 encourage greater accountability without discouraging individual initiative	 said one aide					
familiar with the discussions led by Rouse and Messina. Obama has been aggravated by friction among his							
advisers. ""He's a little frustrated with the internal dysfunction	 the aide said. ""He doesn't like confrontation.""						
But his initial choices to fill open slots have been drawn largely from his administration	 suggesting more						
continuity than change.							
Rouse and Messina see areas for possible bipartisan agreement	 like reauthorizing the nation's education laws to						
include reform measures favored by centrists and conservatives	 passing long-pending trade pacts and possibly						
even producing scaled-back energy legislation. ""You'll hear more about exports and less about public							
spending	 a senior White House official said. ""You'll hear more about initiative and private sector and less

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771310 Date: 08/31/2015							
about the Department of Energy. You'll hear more about government as a financier and less about government							
as a hirer.""							
Obama expressed optimism to me that he could make common cause with Republicans after the midterm							
elections. ""It may be that regardless of what happens after this election	 they feel more responsible	 he said					
either because they didn't do as well as they anticipated	 and so the strategy of just saying no to everything and						
sitting on the sidelines and throwing bombs didn't work for them	 or they did reasonably well	 in which case the					
American people are going to be looking to them to offer serious proposals and work with me in a serious way.""							
I asked if there were any Republicans he trusted enough to work with on economic issues. The first name he							
came up with was Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire	 who initially agreed to serve as Obama's commerce						
secretary before changing his mind. But Gregg is retiring. The only other Republican named by Obama was							
Paul Ryan	 the Wisconsin congressman who has put together a detailed if politically problematic blueprint for						
reducing federal spending. The two men are ideologically poles apart	 but perhaps Obama sees a bit of himself						
in a young	 substantive policy thinker.						
Even if such an alliance emerges	 though	 the next two years will be mostly about cementing what Obama did in					
his first two years — and defending it against challenges in Congress and the courts. ""Even if! had the exact							
same Congress	 even if we don't lose a seat in the Senate and we don't lose a seat in the House	 I think the					
rhythms of the next two years would inevitably be different from the rhythms of the first two years	 Obama						
told me. ""There's going to be a lot of work in this administration just doing things right and making sure that							
new laws are stood up in the ways they're intended.""							
As a senior adviser put it	 ""There's going to be very little incentive for big things over the next two years unless						
there's some sort of crisis."" Yet Obama and his aides still scorn Bill Clinton's small-bore approach. ""It's fair to							
assume you're not going to see school uniforms play a big role in the next two years	 Plouffe told me. ""His						
view is you can't spend two years playing four-corners."" Before he left	 Emanuel told me: ""I'm not of the view						
that you do nothing. I think you've got to have an agenda.""							
But what sort of agenda? Not as sweeping and not as provocative	 say some advisers. ""It will have to be limited						
and focused on the things that are achievable and high priorities for the American people	 Dick Durbin told						
me. Tom Daschle said Obama would have to reach out to adversaries. ""The lessons of the last two years are							
going to be critical	 he told me. ""The key word is 'inclusion.' He's got to find ways to be inclusive.""						
Rendell thinks otherwise. ""Don't care so much about bipartisanship if the Republicans continue to refuse to							
cooperate	 he advised. ""Do what you have to do. Fight back."" At the same time	 he said	 stop moaning about				
what he inherited: ""After the election	 I'd say no more pointing back	 no more blaming the Bush administration.					
It's O.K. to do that during the campaign and then stop. But to do it as much as we do it	 it sounds like a broken						
record. And after two years	 you own it.""						
Obama will own it for another two years	 or six if he can find his way forward. As an author	 Obama					
appreciates the rhythms of a tumultuous story. But who is the protagonist	 really? At bottom	 this president is					
still a mystery to many Americans. During the campaign	 he sold himself— or the idea of himself— more than						
any particular policy	 and voters filled in the lines as they chose. He was	 as he said at the time	 the ultimate				
Rorschach test.							
Now the lines are being filled in further. With each choice Obama makes	 he further defines himself for better						
or worse in Americans' minds. He says he knows where he is going and is gathering momentum despite the							
hurdles ahead. As he told a group of visitors during the week last spring that Congress passed health care and							
his administration reached agreement on an arms-control treaty with Russia	 ""I start slow	 but I finish strong.""					
He will have to	 if the history he is writing is to turn out the way he prefers.

America's Faltering Search for Peace in the Middle East: Openings for Others?
Remarks to staff of the Royal Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs
and, separately, to members of the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs
Ambassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. (USFS, Ret.)
1 September 2010, Oslo, Norway
You have asked me to speak to current American policies in the Middle East, with an emphasis on the prospects for
peace in the Holy Land. You have further suggested that I touch on the relationship of the Gulf Arabs, especially Saudi
Arabia, to this. It is both an honor and a challenge to address this subject in this capital / at this ministry.
The declaration of principles worked out in Oslo seventeen years ago was the last direct negotiation between Israelis and
Palestinian Arabs to reach consequential, positive results. The Oslo accords were a real step toward peace, not another
deceptive pseudo-event in an endlessly unproductive, so-called ""peace process."" And if that one step forward in Oslo in
1993 was followed by several steps backwards, there is a great deal to be learned from how and why that happened.
There can be no doubt about the importance of today's topic. The ongoing conflict in the Holy Land increasingly disturbs
the world's conscience as well as its tranquility. The Israel-Palestine issue began as a struggle in the context of European
colonialism. In the post-colonial era, tension between Israelis and the Palestinians they dispossessed became, by
degrees, the principal source of radicalization and instability in the Arab East and then the Arab world as a whole. It
stimulated escalating terrorism against Israelis at home and their allies abroad. Since the end of the Cold War, the
interaction between Israel and its captive Palestinian population has emerged as the fountainhead of global strife. It is
increasingly difficult to distinguish this strife from a war of religions or a conflict of civilizations.
For better or ill, my own country, the United States has played and continues to play the key international part in this
contest. American policies, more than those of any other external actor, have the capacity to stoke or stifle the hatreds in
the Middle East and to spread or reverse their infection of the wider world. American policies and actions in the Middle
East thus affect much more than that region.
Yet, as I will argue, the United States has been obsessed with process rather than substance. It has failed to involve
parties who are essential to peace. It has acted on Israel's behalf to preempt rather than enlist international and regional
support for peace. It has defined the issues in ways that preclude rather than promote progress. Its concept of a ""peace
process"" has therefore become the handmaiden of Israeli expansionism rather than a driver for peace. There are
alternatives to tomorrow's diplomatic peace pageant on the Potomac. And, as Norway has shown, there is a role for
powers other than America in crafting peace in the Holy Land.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771224 Date: 08/31/2015
Over thirty years ago, at Camp David, Jimmy Carter pushed Israel through the door to peace that Egypt's Anwar Sadat
had opened. Twenty years ago, the first Bush administration pressed Israel to the negotiating table with Palestinian
leaders, setting the stage for their clandestine meetings in Oslo. The capacity of the United States to rally other
governments behind a cause that it espouses may have atrophied, but American power remains far greater than that of
any other nation. Nowhere is this more evident than in the Middle East.
For more than four decades, Israel has been able to rely on aid from the United States to dominate its region militarily and
to sustain its economic prosperity. It has counted on its leverage in American politics to block the application of
international law and to protect itself from the political repercussions of its policies and actions. Unquestioning American
support has enabled Israel to put the seizure of ever more land ahead of the achievement of a modus vivendi with the
Palestinians or other Arabs. Neither violent resistance from the dispossessed nor objections from abroad have brought
successive Israeli governments to question, let alone alter the priority they assign to land over peace.
Ironically, Palestinians too have developed a dependency relationship with America. This has locked them into a political
framework over which Israel exercises decisive influence. They have been powerless to end occupation, pogroms, ethnic
cleansing, and other humiliations by Jewish soldiers and settlers. Nor have they been able to prevent their progressive
confinement in checkpoint-encircled ghettos on the West Bank and the great open-air prison of Gaza.
Despite this appalling record of failure, the American monopoly on the management of the search for peace in Palestine
remains unchallenged. Since the end of the Cold War, Russia — once a contender for countervailing influence in the
region — has lapsed into impotence. The former colonial powers of the European Union, having earlier laid the basis for
conflict in the region, have largely sat on their hands while ringing them, content to let America take the lead. China,
India, and other Asian powers have prudently kept their political and military distance. In the region itself, Iran has
postured and exploited the Palestinian cause without doing anything to advance it. Until recently, Turkey remained aloof.
On rare occasions, as in the case of the 1973 Arab oil embargo, the Arabs have backed their verbal opposition to Israel
with action. Egypt and Jordan have settled into an unpopular coexistence with Israel that is now sustained only by U.S.
subventions. Saudi Arabia has twice taken the initiative to offer Israel diplomatic concessions if it were to conclude
arrangements for peaceful coexistence with the Palestinians. But, overall, Arab governments have earned the contempt
of the Palestinians and their own people for their lack of serious engagement. For the most part, Arab leaders have
timorously demanded that America solve the Israel-Palestine problem for them, while obsequiously courting American
protection against Israel, each other, Iran, and — in some cases — their own increasingly frustrated and angry subjects and
citizens.
Islam charges rulers with the duty to defend the faithful and to uphold justice. It demands that they embody
righteousness. The resentment of mostly Muslim Arabs at their governing elites' failure to meet these standards
generates sympathy for terrorism directed not just at Israel but at both the United States and Arab governments
associated with it.
The perpetrators of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack on the United States saw it in part as reprisal for American
complicity in Israeli cruelties to Palestinians and other Arabs. They justified it as a strike against Washington's protection
of Arab governments willing to overlook American contributions to Muslim suffering. Washington's response to the attack
included suspending its efforts to make peace in the Holy Land as well as invading and occupying Afghanistan and
Iraq. All three actions inadvertently strengthened the terrorist case for further attacks on America and its allies. The
armed struggle between Americans and Muslim radicals has already spilled over to Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, and other

countries. Authoritative voices in Israel now call for adding Iran to the list of countries at war with America. They are
echoed by Zionist and neo-conservative spokesmen in the United States,
The widening involvement of Americans in combat in Muslim lands has inflamed anti-American passions and catalyzed a
metastasis of terrorism. It has caused a growing majority of the world's 1.6 billion Muslims to see the United States as a
menace to their faith, their way of life, their homelands, and their personal security. American populists and European
xenophobes have meanwhile undercut liberal and centrist Muslim arguments against the intolerance that empowers
terrorism by equating terrorism and its extremist advocates with Islam and its followers. The current outburst of bigoted
demagoguery over the construction of an Islamic cultural center and mosque in New York is merely the most recent
illustration of this. It suggests that the blatant racism and Islamophobia of contemporary Israeli politics is contagious. It
rules out the global alliances against religious extremists that are essential to encompass their political defeat.
President Obama's inability to break this pattern must be an enormous personal disappointment to him. He came into
office committed to crafting a new relationship with the Arab and Muslim worlds. His first interview with the international
media was with Arab satellite television. He reached out publicly and privately to Iran. He addressed the Turkish
parliament with persuasive empathy. He traveled to a great center of Islamic learning in Cairo to deliver a remarkably
eloquent message of conciliation to Muslims everywhere. He made it clear that he understood the centrality of injustices
in the Holy Land to Muslim estrangement from the West. He promised a responsible withdrawal from Iraq and a judicious
recrafting of strategy in Afghanistan. Few doubt Mr. Obama's sincerity. Yet none of his initiatives has led to policy
change anyone can detect, let alone believe in
It is not for me to analyze or explain the wide gaps between rhetoric and achievement in the Obama Administration's
stewardship of so many aspects of my country's affairs. American voters will render their first formal verdict on this two
months from tomorrow, on the 2nd of November. The situation in the Holy Land, Iraq, Afghanistan, and adjacent areas is
only part of what they will consider as they do so. But I do think it worthwhile briefly to examine some of the changes in
the situation that ensure that many policies that once helped us to get by in the Middle East will no longer do this.
Let me begin with the ""peace process,"" a hardy perennial of America's diplomatic repertoire that the Obama
Administration will put back on public display tomorrow. In the Cold War, the appearance of an earnest and ""even-
handed"" American search for peace in the Holy Land was the price of U.S. access and influence in the Middle East. It
provided political cover for conservative Arab governments to set aside their anger at American backing of Israel so as to
stand with America and the Western bloc against Soviet Communism. It kept American relations with Israel and the
Arabs from becoming a zero-sum game. It mobilized domestic Jewish support for incumbent presidents. Of course, there
hasn't been an American-led ""peace process"" in the Middle East for at least a decade. Still the conceit of a ""peace
process"" became an essential political convenience for all concerned. No one could bear to admit that the ""peace
process"" had expired. It therefore lived on in phantom form.
Even when there was no ""peace process,"" the possibility of resurrecting one provided hope to the gullible, cover to the
guileful, beguilement for the press, an excuse for doing nothing to those gaining from the status quo, and — last but far
from least — lifetime employment for career ""peace processors."" The perpetual processing of peace without the
requirement to produce it has been especially appreciated by Israeli leaders. It has enabled them to behave like
magicians, riveting foreign attention on meaningless distractions as they systematically removed Palestinians from their
homes, settled half a million or more Jews in newly vacated areas of the occupied territories, and annexed a widening
swath of land to a Jerusalem they insist belongs only to Israel.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771224 Date: 08/31/2015
Palestinian leaders with legitimacy problems have also had reason to collaborate in the search for a ""peace process."" It's
not just that there has been no obviously better way to end their people's suffering. Playing ""peace process"" charades
justifies the international patronage and Israeli backing these leaders need to retain their status in the occupied
territories. It ensures that they have media access and high-level visiting rights in Washington. Meanwhile, for American
leaders, engagement in some sort of Middle East ""peace process"" has been essential to credibility in the Arab and Islamic
worlds, as well as with the ever-generous American Jewish community. Polls show that most American Jews are
impatient for peace. Despite all the evidence to the contrary, they are eager to believe in the willingness of the
government of Israel to trade land for it.
Previous ""peace processes"" have exploited all these impulses. In practice, however, these diplomatic distractions have
served to obscure Israeli actions and evasions that were more often prejudicial to peace than helpful in achieving
it. Behind all the blather, the rumble of bulldozers has never stopped. Given this history, it has taken a year and a half of
relentless effort by U.S. Special Envoy George Mitchell to persuade the parties even to meet directly to talk about talks as
they first did here in Oslo, seventeen years ago. When the curtain goes up on the diplomatic show in Washington
tomorrow, will the players put on a different skit? There are many reasons to doubt that they will.
One is that the Obama administration has engaged the same aging impresarios who staged all the previously failed
""peace processes"" to produce and direct this one with no agreed script. The last time these guys staged such an ill-
prepared meeting, at Camp David in 2000, it cost both heads of delegation, Ehud Barak and Yasser Arafat, their political
authority. It led not to peace but to escalating violence. The parties are showing up this time to minimize President
Obama's political embarrassment in advance of midterm elections in the United States, not to address his agenda — still
less to address each other's agendas. These are indeed difficulties. But the problems with this latest — and possibly final
— iteration of the perpetually ineffectual ""peace process"" are more fundamental.
The Likud Party charter flatly rejects the establishment of a Palestinian Arab state west of the Jordan River and stipulates
that: ""The Palestinians can run their lives freely in the framework of self-rule, but not as an independent and sovereign
state."" This Israeli government is committed to that charter as well as to the Jewish holy war for land in Palestine. It has
no interest in trading land it covets for a peace that might thwart further territorial expansion. It considers itself unbound
by the applicable UN resolutions, agreements from past peace talks, the ""Roadmap,"" or the premise of the ""two-state
solution.""
The Palestinians are desperate for the dignity and security that only the end of the Israeli occupation can provide. But the
authority of Palestinian negotiators to negotiate rests on their recognition by Israel and the United States, not on their
standing in the occupied territories, Gaza, or the Palestinian diaspora. Fatah is the ruling faction in part of Palestine. Its
authority to govern was repudiated by voters in the last Palestinian elections. The Mahmoud Abbas administration retains
power by grace of the Israeli occupation authorities and the United States, which prefer it to the government empowered
by the Palestinian people at the polls. Mr. Abbas's constitutional term of office has long since expired. He presides over
a parliament whose most influential members are locked up in Israeli jails. It is not clear for whom he, his faction, or his
administration can now speak.
So the talks that begin tomorrow promise to be a case of the disinterested going through the motions of negotiating with
the mandate-less. The parties to these talks seek to mollify an America that has severely lessened international
credibility. The United States government had to borrow the modest reputations for objectivity of others — the EU, Russia,
and the UN — to be able to convene this discussion. It will be held under the auspices of an American president who was

publicly humiliated by Israel's prime minister on the issue that is at the center of the Israel-Palestine dispute — Israel's
continuing seizure and colonization of Arab land.
Vague promises of a Palestinian state within a year now waft through the air. But the ""peace process"" has always
sneered at deadlines, even much, much firmer ones. A more definitive promise of an independent Palestine within a year
was made at Annapolis three years ago. Analogous promises of Palestinian self-determination have preceded or resulted
from previous meetings over the decades, beginning with the Camp David accords of 1979. Many in this audience will
recall the five-year deadline fixed at Oslo. The talks about talks that begin tomorrow can yield concrete results only if the
international community is prepared this time to insist on the one-year deadline put forward for recognizing a Palestinian
state. Even then there will be no peace unless long-neglected issues are addressed.
Peace is a pattern of stability acceptable to those with the capacity to disturb it by violence. It is almost impossible to
impose. It cannot become a reality, still less be sustained, if those who must accept it are excluded from it. This reality
directs our attention to who is not at this gathering in Washington and what must be done to remedy the problems these
absences create.
Obviously, the party that won the democratically expressed mandate of the Palestinian people to represent them — Hamas
— is not there. Yet there can be no peace without its buy-in. Egypt and Jordan have been invited as observers. Yet they
have nothing to add to the separate peace agreements each long ago made with Israel. (Both these agreements were
explicitly premised on grudging Israeli undertakings to accept Palestinian self-determination. The Jewish state quickly
finessed both.) Activists from the Jewish diaspora disproportionately staff the American delegation. A failure to reconcile
either American Jews or the Palestine diaspora to peace would doom any accord. But the Palestinian diaspora will be
represented in Washington only in tenuous theory, not in fact.
Other Arabs, including the Arab League and the author of its peace initiative, Saudi Arabia, will not be at the talks
tomorrow. The reasons for this are both simple and complex. At one level they reflect both a conviction that this latest
installment of the ""peace process"" is just another in a long series of public entertainments for the American electorate and
also a lack of confidence in the authenticity of the Palestinian delegation. At another level, they result from the way the
United States has defined the problems to be solved and the indifference to Arab interests and views this definition
evidences. Then too, they reflect disconnects in political culture and negotiating style between Israelis, Arabs, and
Americans.
To begin with, neither Israel nor the conveners of this proposed new ""peace process"" have officially acknowledged or
responded to the Arab peace initiative of 2002. This offered normalization of relations with the Jewish state, should Israel
make peace with the Palestinians. Instead, the United States and the Quartet have seemed to pocket the Arab offer,
ignore its precondition that Israelis come to terms with Palestinians, and gone on to levy new demands.
In this connection, making Arab recognition of Israel's ""right to exist"" the central purpose of the ""peace process"" offends
Arabs on many levels. In framing the issue this way, Israel and the United States appear to be asking for something well
beyond pragmatic accommodation of the reality of a Jewish state in the Middle East. To the Arabs, Americans now seem
to be insisting on Arab endorsement of the idea of the state of Israel, the means by which that state was established, and
the manner in which it has comported itself. Must Arabs really embrace Zionism before Israel can cease expansion and
accept peace?

Arabs and Muslims familiar with European history can accept that European anti-Semitism justified the establishment of a
homeland for traumatized European Jews. But asking them even implicitly to agree that the forcible eviction of
Palestinian Arabs was a morally appropriate means to this end is both a nonstarter and seriously off-putting. So is asking
them to affirm that resistance to such displacement was and is sinful. Similarly, the Arabs see the demand that they
recognize a Jewish state with no fixed borders as a clever attempt to extract their endorsement of Israel's unilateral
expansion at Palestinian expense.
The lack of appeal in this approach has been compounded by a longstanding American habit of treating Arab concerns
about Israel as a form of anti-Semitism and tuning them out. Instead of hearing out and addressing Arab views, U.S.
peace processors have repeatedly focused on soliciting Arab acts of kindness toward Israel. They argue that gestures of
acceptance can help Israelis overcome their Holocaust-inspired political neuroses and take risks for peace.
Each time this notion of Arab diplomacy as psychotherapy for Israelis has been trotted out, it has been met with
incredulity. To most in the region, it encapsulates the contrast between Washington's sympathy and solicitude for Israelis
and its condescendingly exploitative view of Arabs. Some see it as a barely disguised appeal for a policy of appeasement
of Israel. Still others suspect an attempt to construct a ""peace process"" in which Arabs begin to supply Israel with gifts of
carrots so that Americans can continue to avoid applying sticks to it.
The effort to encourage Arab generosity as an offset to American political pusillanimity vis-a-vis Israel is ludicrously
unpersuasive. It has failed so many times that it should be obvious that it will not work. Yet it was a central element of
George Mitchell's mandate for ""peace process"" diplomacy. And it appears to have resurfaced as part of the proposed
follow-up to tomorrow's meeting between the parties in Washington. It should be no puzzle why the Saudis and other
Arabs could not be persuaded to join this gathering.
As a last thought before turning to what must be done, let me make a quick comment on a relevant cultural factor. Arabic
has two quite different words that are both translated as ""negotiation,"" making a distinction that doesn't exist in either
English or Hebrew. One word, ""musaawama,"" refers to the no-holds-barred bargaining process that takes place in
bazaars between strangers who may never see each other again and who therefore feel no obligation not to scam each
other. Another, ""mufaawadhat,"" describes the dignified formal discussions about matters of honor and high principle that
take place on a basis of mutual respect and equality between statesmen who seek a continuing relationship.
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's travel to Jerusalem was a grand act of statesmanship to initiate a process of
mufaawadhat — relationship-building between leaders and their polities. So was the Arab peace initiative of 2002. It
called for a response in kind. The West muttered approvingly but did not act. After a while, Israel responded with
intermittent, somewhat oblique suggestions of willingness to haggle over terms. But an offer to bicker over the terms on
which a grand gesture has been granted is, not surprisingly, seen as insultingly unresponsive.
I cite this not to suggest that non-Arabs should adopt Arabic canons of thought, but to make a point about diplomatic
effectiveness. To move a negotiating partner in a desired direction, one must understand how that partner understands
things and help him to see a way forward that will bring him to an end he has been persuaded to want. One of the
reasons we can't seem to move things as we desire in the Middle East is that we don't make much effort to understand
how others reason and how they rank their interests. In the case of the Israel-Palestine conundrum, we Americans are
long on empathy and expertise about Israel and very, very short on these for the various Arab parties. The essential
militarism of U.S. policies in the Middle East adds to our difficulties. We have become skilled at killing Arabs. We have
forgotten how to listen to them or persuade them.

I am not myself an ""Arabist,"" but I am old enough to remember when there were more than a few such people in the
American diplomatic service. These were officers who had devoted themselves to the cultivation of understanding and
empathy with Arab leaders so as to be able to convince these leaders that it was in their own interest to do things we saw
as in our interest. If we still have such people, we are hiding them well; we are certainly not applying their skills in our
Middle East diplomacy.
This brings me to a few thoughts about the Western and Arab interests at stake in the Holy Land and their implications for
what must be done.
In foreign affairs, interests are the measure of all things. My assumption is that Americans and Norwegians, indeed
Europeans in general, share common interests that require peace in the Holy Land. To my mind, these interests include -
but are, of course, not limited to — gaining security and acceptance for a democratic state of Israel; eliminating the gross
injustices and daily humiliations that foster Arab terrorism against Israel and its foreign allies and supporters, as well as
friendly Arab regimes; and reversing the global spread of religious strife and prejudice, including, very likely, a revival of
anti-Semitism in the West if current trends are not arrested. None of these aspirations can be fulfilled without an end to
the Israeli occupation and freedom for Palestinians.
Arab states, like Saudi Arabia, also have compelling reasons to want relief from occupation as well as self-determination
for Palestinians. They may not be concerned to preserve Israel's democracy, as we are, but they share an urgent interest
in ending the radicalization of their own populations, curbing the spread of Islamist terrorism, and eliminating the tensions
with the West that the conflict in the Holy Land fuels. These are the concerns that have driven them to propose peace, as
they very clearly did eight years ago. For related reasons, Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah has made inter-faith dialogue
and the promotion of religious tolerance a main focus of his domestic and international policy.
As the custodian of two of Islam's three sacred places of pilgrimage — Mecca and Medina — Saudi Arabia has long
transcended its own notorious religious narrow-mindedness to hold the holy places in its charge open to Muslims of all
sects and persuasions. This experience, joined with Islamic piety, reinforces a Saudi insistence on the exemption of
religious pilgrimage to Jerusalem from political interference or manipulation. The Ottoman Turks were careful to ensure
freedom of access for worship to adherents of the three Abrahamic faiths when they administered the city. It is an interest
that Jews, Christians, and Muslims share.
There is, in short, far greater congruity between Western and Arab interests affecting the Israel-Palestine dispute than is
generally recognized. This can be the basis for creative diplomacy. The fact that this has not occurred reflects
pathologies of political life in the United States that paralyze the American diplomatic imagination. Tomorrow's meeting
may well demonstrate that, the election of Barack Obama notwithstanding, the United States is still unfit to manage the
achievement of peace between Israel and the Arabs. If so, it is in the American interest as well as everyone else's that
others become the path-breakers, enlisting the United States as best they can in support of what they achieve, but not
expecting America to overcome its incapacity to lead.
Here, I think, there is a lesson to be drawn from the Norwegian experience in the 1990s. The Clinton Administration was
happy to organize the public relations for the Oslo accords but did not take ownership of them. It did little to protect them
from subversion and overthrow, and nothing to insist on their implementation. Only a peace process that is protected
from Israel's ability to manipulate American politics can succeed.

This brings me to how Europeans and Arabs might work together to realize the objectives both share with most
Americans: establishing internationally recognized borders for Israel, securing freedom for the Palestinians, and ending
the stimulus to terrorism in the region and beyond it that strife in the Holy Land entails. I have only four suggestions to
present today. I expect that more ideas will emerge from the discussion period. A serious effort to cooperate with the
Arabs of the sort that Norway is uniquely capable of contriving could lead to the development of still more options for joint
or parallel action on behalf of peace.
Now to my suggestions, presented in ascending order of difficulty, from the least to the most controversial.
First, get behind the Arab peace initiative. Saudi Arab culture frowns on self-promotion and the Kingdom is less gifted
than most at public diplomacy. Political factors inhibit official Arab access to the Israeli press. The Israeli media have
published some — mostly dismissive — commentary on the Arab peace initiative but left most Israelis ignorant of its
contents and unfamiliar with its text. Why not buy space in the Israeli media to give Israelis a chance to read the Arab
League declaration and consider the opportunities it presents? I suspect the Saudis, as well as other members of the
Arab League, would consider it constructive for an outside party to do this. It might facilitate other sorts of cooperation
with them in which European capabilities can also compensate for Arab reticence. The Turks and other non-Arab
Muslims should be brought in as full participants in any such efforts. This wouldn't be bad for Europe's relations with
both. By the way, given the U.S. media's notorious one-sidedness and American ignorance about the Arab peace plan, a
well-targeted advertising campaign in the United States might not be a bad idea either.
Second, help create a Palestinian partner for peace. There can be no peace with Israel unless there are officials who
are empowered by the Palestinian people to negotiate and ratify it. Israel has worked hard to divide the Palestinians so
as to consolidate its conquest of their homeland. Saudi Arabia has several times sought to create a Palestinian peace
partner for Israel by bringing Fatah, Hamas, and other factions together. On each occasion, Israel, with U.S. support, has
acted to preclude this. Active organization of non-American Western support for diplomacy aimed at restoring a unity
government to the Palestinian Authority could make a big difference. The Obama Administration would be under strong
domestic political pressure to join Israel in blocking a joint European-Arab effort to accomplish this. Under some
circumstances, however, it might welcome being put to this test.
Third, reaffirm and enforce international law. The UN Security"							
Council is charged with enforcing the rule of law								
internationally. In the case of the Middle East	 however	 the Council's position at the apex of the international system has						
served to erode and subvert the ideal of a rule-bound international order. Almost forty American vetoes have prevented								
the application to the Israeli occupying authorities of the Geneva Conventions	 the Nuremberg precedents	 human rights						
conventions	 and relevant Security Council directives. American diplomacy on behalf of the Jewish state has silenced the							
collective voice of the international community as Israel has illegally colonized and annexed broad swaths of occupied								
territory	 administered collective punishment to a captive people	 assassinated their political leaders	 massacred civilians					
barred UN investigators	 defied mandatory Security Council resolutions	 and otherwise engaged in scofflaw behavior						
usually with only the flimsiest of legally irrelevant excuses.								
If ethnic cleansing	 settlement activity	 and the like are not just ""unhelpful"" but illegal	 the international community should					
find a way to say so	 even if the UN Security Council cannot. Otherwise	 the most valuable legacy of Atlantic civilization -						
its vision of the rule of law — will be lost. When one side to a dispute is routinely exempted from principles	 all exempt							
themselves	 and the law of the jungle prevails. The international community needs collectively to affirm that Israel	 both						
as occupier and as regional military hegemon	 is legally accountable internationally for its actions. If the UN General							
Assembly cannot ""unite for peace"" to do what an incapacitated Security Council cannot	 member states should not shrink

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771224 Date: 08/31/2015								
from working in conference outside the UN framework. All sides in the murder and mayhem in the Holy Land and beyond								
need to understand that they are not above the law. If this message is firmly delivered and enforced	 there will be a better							
chance for peace.								
Fourth	 set a deadline linked to an ultimatum. Accept that the United States will frustrate any attempt by the UN							
Security Council to address the continuing impasse between Israel and the Palestinians. Organize a global conference								
outside the UN system to coordinate a decision to inform the parties to the dispute that if they cannot reach agreement in								
a year	 one of two solutions will be imposed. Schedule a follow-up conference for a year later. The second conference							
would consider whether to recommend universal recognition of a Palestinian state in the area beyond Israel's 1967								
borders or recognition of Israel's achievement of de jure as well as de facto sovereignty throughout Palestine (requiring								
Israel to grant all governed by it citizenship and equal rights at pain of international sanctions	 boycott	 and						
disinvestment). Either formula would force the parties to make a serious effort to strike a deal or to face the								
consequences of their recalcitrance. Either formula could be implemented directly by the states members of the								
international community. Admittedly	 any serious deadline would provoke a political crisis in Israel and lead to diplomatic							
confrontation with the United States as well as Israel	 despite the Obama Administration itself having proclaimed a one-							
year deadline in order to entice the Palestinians to tomorrow's talks. Yet both Israel and the United States would benefit								
immensely from peace with the Palestinians.								
Time is running out. The two-state solution may already have been overtaken by Israeli land grabs and settlement								
activity. Another cycle of violence is likely in the offing. If so	 it will not be local or regional	 but global in its reach. Israel's						
actions are delegitimizing and isolating it even as they multiply the numbers of those in the region and beyond who are								
determined to destroy it. Palestinian suffering is a reproach to all humanity that posturing alone cannot begin to								
alleviate. It has become a cancer on the Islamic body politic. It is infecting every extremity of the globe with the rage								
against injustice that incites terrorism.								
It is time to try new approaches. That is why the question of whether there is a basis for expanded diplomatic cooperation								
between Europeans and Arabs is such a timely one. And it is why I was pleased as well as honored to have been asked								
to set the stage for a discussion of this issue.

people. And that's the first step to

Already a hero to conservatives							
for successfully suing the Clinton							
administration over the provision							
in the Brady Handgun Violence							
Prevention Act requiring law							
enforcement to conduct criminal							
background checks of gun							
purchasers	 Mack reemerged in						
the Obama era as the archetypal							
local lawman who vowed to resist							
the tyrannical federal							
government. Along with a few							
dozen former and active military							
and law enforcement personnel							
Mack helped form a self-styled							
Tea Party militia called the							
Oathkeepers. Galvanized by their							
fear of creeping socialism	 the						
Oathkeepers solemnly swore to							
refuse tyrannical federal orders							
such as cooperating with foreign							
troops and forcing Americans							
into concentration camps.							
Because the group's members							
trained for combat	 the vow came						
with suggestion of armed							
resistance.							
Besides Mack	 the Oathkeepers						
attracted a coterie of militia							
movement retreads into its ranks.							
The most well-established figure							
was Mike Vanderboegh	 a						
longtime militia fanatic who							
published a booklet in the mid-							
1990s entitled Strategy and							
Tactics for a Militia Civil War							
calling for sniper attacks on ""war							
criminals	 secret policemen	 rats.""					
With Obama in office							
Vandeboegh churned out anti-							
government screeds on right-wing							
blogs with renewed passion and							
supported his efforts by cashing							
in the $1	300 in federal disability						
compensation he received each							
month.							
For all the energy the far right							
exerted in its campaign to							
strangle Obama's agenda	 it was a						
Democrat who posed the greatest							
threat to the passage of health							
care reform. Representative Bart							
Stupak of Michigan had been in							
office since 1993	 placing him						
among the senior leadership of							
the so-called centrist Blue Dog							
Democrats. When health care							
reform was introduced in							
Congress	 Stupak became the						
leader of an informal caucus of							
anti-abortion Democrats	 making						
him the de facto swing vote on							
the House version of the bill. By							
extension	 Stupak was the point						
man in the campaign to ensure							
that the bill would not allow							
federal funding for abortion for							
low-income women.							
But after close consultation with							
leaders of the U.S. Conference of							
Catholic Bishops	 Stupak went a						
step further. He introduced a							
draconian amendment to block							
women from paying for abortions							
from even their own private							
insurance plans. The amendment							
which passed the House but was							
shut down in the Senate	 became						
a key sticking point in health care							
negotiations. 'He's a big hero							
now in the pro-life community							
former Bush Catholic issues							
adviser Deal Hudson told me in							
November 2009. ""Thanks to him							
this is the first time I can							
remember the pro-life Democrats							
having any power.""							
To the chagrin of the							
Republicans	 Stupak entertained						
offers of compromise from the							
Democratic leadership.							
According to Hudson	 the						
Catholic Bishops were keen to							
see health care reform pass	 but						
only if the bill contained a clear							
provision forbidding patients							
from spending federal money on							
abortion. Finally	 in March	 after					
pressure from House Majority							
Leader Nancy Pelosi	 Obam.a						
agreed to sign an executive order							
forbidding the federal funding of							
abortion. Stupak had been							
mollified. Now he and his anti-							
abortion caucus pledged to							
deliver the swing votes the							
Democrats needed to pass the							
bill. As soon as reports seeped out							
declaring the imminent passage							
of health care reform	 major						
right-wing blogs like							
RedState.org churned out virulent							
denunciations of Stupak	 calling						
him a traitor and sellout. The blog							
comment sections filled up with							
dozens of diatribes referring to							
Stupak in language previously							
reserved for Dr. George Tiller:							
Bart the Baby-Killer.""							
On March 20	 thousands of Tea						
Party activists surrounded the							
Capitol's Longworth Building in							
expectation of Obama's pep talk							
to the House Democrats and the							
health care vote. Democratic							
Representative john Lewis	 a						
hero of the civil rights movement							
and Representative Barney Frank							
the first openly gay member of							
Congress	 passed through the						
crowd on their way inside the							
Capitol. Thsligger!"" a demonstrator							
barked at Lewis. Another called							
Frank a ""faggot	 eliciting						
laughter and cheers from nearby							
protesters. Meanwhile	 as another						
African-American Democrat							
Representative Emanuel Cleaver							
ascended the Capitol steps	 a						
protester who had been screaming							
at Lewis and Frank spat on his							
face.							
With the demonstration carried							
on into the night	 cries of ""Kill						
the bill!'' drifted into calls for							
violence. ""I would gladly stand							
with any of you men here and							
take these fascists down	 a man						
in camouflage battle dress							
uniform proclaimed in front of an							
amateur videographer	 pointing						
toward the Capitol. ""You haven't							
heard the last of me!""							
The next day	 Republican						
members of Congress emerged							
from the Longworth Building to							
salute the Tea Partiers. The							
demonstrators cheered wildly for							
their proxies on the inside.							
Finally	 after hours of						
impassioned speeches on the							
House floor	 the bill passed. But						
the drama was hardly over.							
Republican Representative Joe							
Pitts	 an anti-abortion Catholic						
who co-authored Stupak's							
original amendment	 demanded a						
motion to bring it back to the							
floor for a vote	 a transparent						
exercise in grandstanding that							
was certain to fail. In response							
Stupak rushed to the podium with							
a stinging rebuke to Pitts and the							
Republicans. ""The motion to							
commit does not support life							
Stupak declared. ""It is the							
Democrats who have stood up....""							
Heckling from the Republican							
side interrupted his statement. As							
Stupak looked around the House							
chamber	 Rep. Randy						
Neugebauer	 a right-wing						
Republican from Texas who							
openly supported the Birther							
movement	 began shouting at him						
from the backbench	 ""Baby						
killer!"" Other Republicans joined							
in	 parroting base insults.						
While the Republicans sank their							
heads in defeat	 some more						
militant devotees of the Tea Party							
movement called for a right-wing							
Kristallnacht. ""If you wish to							
send a message that Pelosi and							
her party cannot fail to hear							
break their windows							
Vanderboegh of the Oathkeepers							
wrote on a far-right blog hours							
after the bill passed. ""Break them							
NOW. Break them and run to							
break again."" Within three days							
windows and doors at Democratic							
Party headquarters in New York							
Kansas and Arizona had been							
shattered.							
Meanwhile	 at least 10						
Democratic members of Congress							
reported receiving death threats.							
Images of nooses were faxed to							
the offices of Stupak and James							
Clyburn	 an African-American						
congressman from South							
Carolina. Representative Anthony							
Weiner	 an especially vocal						
proponent of health care reform							
received a menacing letter filled							
with white powder. The brother							
of Representative Torn Perriello							
another health care supporter	 had						
his home gas line deliberately							
sabotaged after a local Tea Party							
organizer posted his address							
online (he had meant to post the							
congressman's) and encouraged							
activists to ""drop by"" to express							
their anger about Perriello's							
recent vote. In Tucson	 Arizona						
the windows of Democratic							
Representative Gabrielle							
Giffbrds' office were shattered by							
shots from a pellet gun. And a							
brick was thrown through the							
window of Representative Louise							
Slaughter's office in New York as							
her voicemail filled with threats							
of impending sniper attacks.							
After the Passage of the health							
care bill	 the Tea Party floated						
into a gray zone between							
authoritarianism and anarchy.							
Crusading to restore a holy social							
order	 they promoted disorder.						
Claiming to protect democracy							
they smashed windows of elected							
representatives. Warning of death							
panels	 they called in death						
threats. With the atmosphere of							
violence thickening	 Palin took to						
her Twitter account to issue a							
battle cry: ""Don't Retreat							
Instead—RELOAD!"" Thus							
concluded the first phase of the							
Obama era that was to usher in a							
peaceable kingdom of							
bipartisanship.

Jean-Paul Sartre,
""Anti-Semite and
Jew""
I am not sure when I first detected
the noxious fumes that would
envelop the conservative
movement in the Obama era. It
might have been early on, in
April 2009, when I visited a
series of gun shows in rural
California and Nevada. Perusing
tables piled high with high-
caliber semi-automatic weapons
and chatting with anyone in my
vicinity, I heard urgent warnings
of mass roundups, concentration
camps, and a socialist
government in Washington.
""These people that are purchasing
these guns are people that are
worried about what's going on in
this country,"" a gun dealer told
me outside a show in Reno.
""Good luck Obama,"" a young gun
enthusiast remarked to me. ""We
outnumber him 100 to 1."" At this
time, the Tea Party movement
had not even registered on the
national media's radar.
In September 2009, I led a panel
discussion about this book inside
an auditorium filled with nearly
100 students and faculty at the
University of California-
Riverside. Beside me sat Jonathan
Walton, an African-American
professor of religious studies and
prolific writer, and Mark Takano,
an erudite, openly gay former
Democratic congressional
candidate and local community
college trustee. In the middle of
our discussion, a dozen College
Republicans stormed the front of
the stage with signs denouncing
me as a ""left-wing hack"" while a
hysterical young man leaped from
the crowd, blowing kisses
mockingly at Takano while
heckling Walton as a ""racist.""
Afterward, university police

officers insisted on escorting me
to my ride after the right-wing
heckler attempted to follow me as
he shouted threats.
Who was this stalker? Just a
concerned citizen worried about
taxes? His name was Ryan Sorba
and he was an operative of a
heavily funded national
conservative youth outfit, the
Intercollegiate Studies Institute.
Besides founding dozens of
Republican youth groups across
the country, Sorba has devoted an
exceptional amount of energy to
his interest in homosexuals. His
intellectual output consists of a
tract titled The Born Gay Hoax,
arguing that homosexuality is at
once a curable disease and a
bogus trend manufactured by
academic leftists. Adding to his
credentials, Sorba has a history of
run-ins with the law, he explained
when I called him about the
order.
My encounter with this
aggressive right-wing cadre
seemed a strange, isolated event.
But the hostility turned out to be
symptomatic of the intensifying
campaign to delegitimize
President Obama and his allies in
Congress. The Right's days of
rage were only beginning.
Through his first year in office,
Obama seemed oblivious to the
threat of the far right. He
campaigned against partisanship,
declaring that there were ""no red
states"" and no ""conservative
America."" Apparently, he thought
it was merely a contrivance or
myth that there were people who
rejected science, demonized gays,
assailed minority and women's
rights -- or that they genuinely
believed in what they said.

Speaking of changing
Washington, Obama seemed to
think that the entire history of
politics since the rise of Reagan
and the Right and their strategies
of polarization was not deeply
rooted but a superficial problem
attributable to certain ""divisive""
personalities, easily wiped away
with gestures toward
bipartisanship. His view of the
parties was that they were simply
mirror images sharing
fundamental beliefs but separated
by ""partisans."" The skilled and
devoted community organizer
could bring them together.
Many of his supporters in the
media, often part and parcel of
political wars over the years,
reinforced and amplified his
innocence, proclaiming he was
the one at last who could ""bridge•
the partisan divide."" Andrew
Sullivan, a disaffected
conservative who once called
critics of George W. Bush
policies ""fifth columnists"" but
now fervently supporting Obama,
wrote that the new president was
destined to become ""a liberal
Reagan who can reunite
America."" This optimism
pervaded the Obama White
House as the president and his
aides sought out Republicans
willing to vote for his programs.
After all, why couldn't we all just
get along?
In his autobiographical book The
Audacity of Hope, Obama
highlighted a key component of
his political strategy: ""I serve as a
blank screen on which people of
vastly different political stripes
project their own views."" Once he
was elected, conservatives
concluded that they could reverse
Obama's strength by transforming
him into a human tableau for the

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770985 Date: 08/31/2015
most fearsome images they could
conjure.
Obama's multiracial background
was crucial in cultivating
resentment among the shock
troops. Those who rejected
Obama's legitimacy to serve as
president on the basis of his
background gave birth to the
""Birther"" movement that sought
to challenge his citizenship. The
movement's most visible figure,
and therefore the most eccentric,
was Orly Taitz, a dentist and self-
trained lawyer who had
immigrated from the former
Soviet republican of Moldova to
Israel before settling in the
conservative bastion of Orange
County, California. Convinced by
claims on the far-right Web site
WorldNetDaily that Obama
planned to create a ""civilian
national security force,"" Taitz
told me she ""realized that Obama
was another Stalin--it's a cross
between Stalinist USSR and
Hitler's Germany.""
After becoming transfixed by
online conspiracy theories
claiming Obama's family had
forged his birth certificate in
Hawaii, Taitz snapped into
action. She filed a lawsuit in
November 2008 with California
Secretary of State Debra Bowen
demanding an investigation into
Obama's eligibility to serve as
president. Taitz's plaintiff in the
case was Wiley Drake, an Orange
County radio preacher and former
second vice president of the
Southern Baptist Convention who
once publicly prayed for Obama's
death. While her lawsuit went
nowhere, and subsequent suits
earned her angry rebukes from
judges, Taitz became an instant
media sensation, delivering

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770985 Date: 08/31/2015
heavily accented screeds against
Obama before friendly
interviewers from Sean Haimity
to CNN's Lou Dobbs, who Taitz
called her ""greatest supporter""
and who was eventually fired as
an indirect result of his hosting of
her.
In March 2009, Texas Rep.
Randy Neugebauer signed on to a
Birther bill proposing that future
presidential candidates must
prove their citizenship before
becoming eligible to campaign.
The Birther movement had found
its voice in goverment and made
an indelible impact on the
Republican grassroots. By June
2009, 28 percent of Republican
respondents to a Kos/Research
2000 poll said they thought
Obama wasn't born in the United
States, while 30 percent ""weren't
sure."" ""Obama should be in the
Big House,"" Taitz shrieked to me,
""not the White House!""
When Obama announced health
care reform as the first major
initiative of his administration,
the conservative movement
activated a campaign of
demonization -- transformational
politics -- designed to turn Obama
into the ""Other,"" making him
seem as unfamiliar, and therefore
as threatening, as possible. When
the president urged the Congress
to deliver a health care reform bill
in 2009, the Right staged a living
theater of political hatred,
Obama's dream of bipartisanship
transformed into a nightmarish
version of ""Marat/Sade."" On
September 12, 2009, tens of
thousands of far-right activists
belonging to a loose
confederation of anti-government
groups called the Tea Party
Patriots converged on
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770985 Date: 08/31/2015

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770985 Date: 08/31/2015
Washington's National Mall for a
giant protest against the Obama
health care plan. The date was
significant: Fox News's top-
ranked talk show host Glenn
Beck had declared the birth of the
""9-12 Project"" to restore the sense
of unity -- and siege mentality --
that Americans experienced on
September 11, 2001. But this
time, Obama -- not Osama -- was
the enemy.
While covering the rally, I
witnessed sign after sign
declaring Obama a greater danger
to America's security than al-
Qaida; demonstrators held images
that juxtaposed Obama's face
with images of evildoers from
Hitler to Pol Pot to Bin Laden;
others carried signs questioning
Obama's status as a U.S. citizen.
""We can fight al-Qaida, we can't
kill Obama,"" said an aging
demonstrator. Another told me,
""Obama is the biggest Nazi in the
world,"" pointing to placards he
had fashioned depicting Obama
and House Majority Leader
Nancy Pelosi in SS outfits.
According to another activist,
Obama's agenda was similar to
Hitler's: ""Hitler took over the
banking industry, did he not? And
Hitler had his own personal secret
service police. [The community-
organizing group] ACORN is an
extension of that.""
The seemingly incongruous Tea
Party propaganda recalled signs
waved by right-wing Jewish
settlers during rallies against
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin and his support of the
peace process, portraying him as
an SS officer and as the French
collaborator Marshall Petain. In
1995, amid the provocative
atmosphere, a young right-wing
Jewish zealot assassinated Rabin.

The Israeli tragedy was a
cautionary example of targeted
hatred leading to violence.
Members of the Tea Party
""Patriots"" did not seem to care
that their rhetoric was irrational,
or that comparing Obama to
Hitler and Stalin was
contradictory and obviously
hyperbolic. Their motives were
entirely negative. By purging
government of the multicultural
evil that had seized power
through illicit means (several
activists told me they believed
ACORN helped Obama steal the
election), they were convinced
that a mythical golden American
yesteryear would return. They
had no interest in building
anything new or even articulating
an agenda, much less discussing
the merits of policies. The Tea
Party's primary concern was
cultural purification -- freedom
from, not freedom to. Against the
dark image of the president and
his liberal allies, Tea Party
activists defined themselves as
the children of light. The racial
subtext was always transparent.
The Tea Party's strategy rested on
a guerrilla campaign of chaos and
sabotage designed not only to
intimidate Democrats but also to
disorient independent voters who
might have supported health care
reform. The Tea Partiers were
convinced this would be an easy
feat, since they believed the
majority of the country was on
their side -- that they represented
the ""Real America."" At the 9-12
rally Matt Kibbe, one of the
march organizers, told the crowd
that ABC News was reporting
that 1 million to 1.5 million
people were in attendance,
something ABC denied, saying
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770985 Date: 08/31/2015

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770985 Date: 08/31/2015
""ABCNews.com reported an
approximate figure of 60,000 to
70,000 protesters."" Then Armey
led the crowd in a chant of
""Freedom works! Freedom
works!"" Unknown to most of the
Tea Partiers, they were intoning
the name of a corporate-funded
Beltway advocacy group, not the
battle cry of Mel Gibson William
Wallace in Braveheart.
Contrary to its image as a
grassroots movement mobilized
to stifle the machinations of
Washington elites, the Tea Party
movement was the creation of a
constellation of industry-funded
conservative groups with close
Republican ties. The movement's
leading puppet-master was Dick
Armey, who directed resources
and talking points to the Tea
Party ""Patriots"" from his
Washington, D.C.-based
advocacy group, FreedomWorks.
Among the corporate clients of
Armey's lobbying firm, which he
was forced to leave as a result of
his involvement in the Tea
Parties, was the pharmaceutical
giant Bristol Myers Squibb, a
company with a clear interest in
defeating health care reform.
(Armey's other ""real American""
clients included the Marxist terror
cult, People's Mojahedin of Iran,
which received funding and
assistance from Saddam Hussein
in order to launch terrorist strikes
throughout the 1990's against
Iranian civilian targets.) Armey
collected a consulting fee of
$250,000 directly from
FreedomWorks and $300,000
from allied astroturf front groups.
FreedomWorks paid out much of
its money to an assortment of
Republican political consultants.
If Armey was the Tea Party king,

Sarah PalM was eager to be
crowned the Tea Party queen.
Just days after Obama's
inauguration, Palin abruptly quit
her job as Alaskan governor to
vie for the honor. PalM's motives
for quitting became clear when
she inked a lucrative deal to write
her political memoir Going
Rogue, signed on as a regular
contributor to Fox News, and
received $1 million an episode for
a reality show on cable television,
""Sarah Palin's Alaska."" PalM's
book tour, which sent her through
Middle America in a luxuriously
outfitted bus, resembled both a
presidential campaign and a
traveling carnival.
Whether or not PalM intends to
run for president, her growing
media presence has magnified her
influence within the Republican
Party. Yet the ever-expanding
Palin phenomenon was greeted
with hostility by Republican
politicos desperately seeking to
expand the party's base after the
drubbing in 2008. Former
McCain campaign manager Steve
Schmidt warned that Palin's
nomination in 2012 would be
""catastrophic"" for the GOP. His
doomsday prediction was backed
by an October Gallup poll
revealing her as one of the most
polarizing and unpopular political
figures in the country with a
disapproval rating of over 50
percent. Unfortunately for
Schmidt and other party
pragmatists, those who approve
of Palin represent the heartbeat of
the Republican Party, its most
fervent activists, and cannot be
dissuaded from following her,
even if she is leading the party off
a cliff.
A November 2009 special

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770985 Date: 08/31/2015
congressional election in New
York's heavily Republican 23rd
district was the first major test of
Palin's power. Along with a
parade of nationally recognized
conservatives, Palin endorsed
Doug Hoffman, an unknown far-
right third-party candidate closely
allied with the Tea Party, helping
to force a popular moderate
Republican politician, Dede
Scozzafava, from the race. In the
end, Palin's ideological purge in
upstate New York led to an
improbable Democratic victory,
the first in that district in more
than 100 years. After the disaster
Palin and her allies claimed
victory, insisting they had at least
hastened the purge of
ideologically impure Republicans
from the party. She went on to
endorse Rand Paul, the son of
right-wing libertarian Rep. Ron
Paul and a candidate in
Kentucky's GOP senatorial
primary, while Dick Cheney went
out of his way to endorse Rand's
regular Republican opponent,
Trey Grayson, the Kentucky
secretary of state.
Following the Tea Party script of
avoiding social issues like
abortion and gay marriage in
order to obscure the large
presence of the Christian Right
within the movement's ranks, the
self-described ""hardcore pro-
lifer"" Palin recast herself as a
libertarian concerned primarily
with issues of ""economic
freedom."" She claimed the
Democratic ""cap and trade"" plan
to limit carbon emissions would
harm the livelihood of blue-collar
workers, and she assailed health
care reform as a Trojan Horse for
""socialism"" (though she admitted
her family ""used to hustle over
the border"" to take advantage of

Canada's single-payer health care
system). But no Palin attack had
as much effect as the one she
blasted out on her Facebook page
claiming the Obama health care
plan included a provision for
""death panels"" that would
recommend euthanasia for
severely ill patients like her
Down syndrome-afflicted son,
Trig. With the click of a button,
Palin transformed the tone of the
health care debate from rancorous
to poisonous.
The source of Palin's ""death
panels"" smear was a practiced
propagandist, former New York
Lieutenant Governor Betsy
McCaughey. When President Bill
Clinton introduced health care
reform during his first term,
McCaughey falsely claimed in an
article published in the New
Republic and widely circulated by
Republicans, that the plan would
force consumers to drop their
private plans and buy into the
government's program (the article
would go on to win a National
Magazine Award and then be
retracted years later by the New
Republic's editors). Now she was
back in the spotlight, pushing a
rumor that would be voted by the
non-partisan fact-checking Web
site Politifact.com as ""the lie of
2009."" McCaughey's latest
innuendo was boosted by the cult
of political crank Lyndon
LaRouche, which mobilized to
push the rumor into the
mainstream.
In June 2009, one of LaRouche's
top lieutenants publicly
confronted Ezekiel Emanuel, the
National Institute of Health's
chief bioethicist and brother of
White House chief of staff Rahm
Emanuel, accusing him of

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770985 Date: 08/31/2015
seeking to reintroduce Hitler's T-
4 program to kill the handicapped
through health care reform.
""President Obama has put in
place a reform apparatus reviving
the euthanasia of Hitler Germany
in 1939, that began the genocide
there,"" LaRouche staffer Anton
Chaitkin charged. Soon,
LaRouche's followers were on
street corners around the country
with posters depicting Obama
with a Hitler moustache. At a
town hall forum on health care
reform hosted by Democratic
Rep. Barney Frank, a LaRouche
follower waved one of the
Obama-as-Hitler posters and
demanded, ""Why do you continue
to support a Nazi policy, as
Obama has expressly supported
this policy?""
Two months later, after Palin
whispered the rumor on
Facebook, prominent
conservatives from former
Speaker of the House Newt
Gingrich to ranking Senate
Finance Committee member
Charles Grassley parroted her
claims before audiences of
indignant Tea Partiers. Not to be
outdone, Glenn Beck devoted an
extended rant on his show to the
reality of death panels. Echoing
the LaRouche cultists, Beck
accused Ezekiel Emanuel of ""the
devaluing of human life, putting a
price on each individual."" He
thundered, ""The death panel is
not a firing squad. Rationing is
inevitable and they know it!""
The death panel rumor served a
variety of functions, all useful to
the movement, but not necessarily
to the Republican Party. Most
importantly, the rumor resonated
both with hard-core libertarians
who resented the very existence

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770985 Date: 08/31/2015
of the federal government and
Christian Right activists who
viewed the legalization of
abortion as a slippery slope to
government-sponsored
euthanasia. The hysteria it
engendered helped repair the rift
exposed by the Terri Schiavo
charade in 2005, when the
evangelical conservative James
Dobson publicly clashed with
Armey, the libertarian leader,
over the right of the government
to interfere in a private family
matter of life and death.
The slurring of Obama as a sort
of sleeper agent crypto-Muslim
helped bring the neoconservatives
back into the fray. The new neo-
con generation was led by Dick
Cheney's daughter, Liz, who
founded an anti-Obama advocacy
group, Keep America Safe, by
leveraging donations from pro-
Israel sources. Asked by CNN's
Larry King about the Birther
movement that was challenging
Obama's status as an American
citizen, Liz Cheney remarked,
""One of the reasons you see
people so concerned about this is
people are uncomfortable with
having for the first time ever, I
think, a president who seems so
reluctant to defend the nation
overseas."" With the libertarians,
Christian Right, and the neo-cons
seated around the same table,
united in resentment of the alien
president, the conservative
movement was whole again.
The experiments in ""Terror
Management Theory"" of Sheldon
Solomon, professor of
psychology at Skidmore College,
Jeff Greenberg, professor of
psychologist at the Unviersity of
Arizona, and Tom Pyszczynski,
professor of psychology at the

University of Colorado, have
demonstrated the connection
between fear of death and
intensification of conservative
attitudes. The findings help
explain the effectiveness of the
death panel rumor and
insinuations by conservative
figures that Obama was not truly
American and somehow
sympathetic to Islamic terrorists.
Indeed, these seemingly irrational
smears were guided by tactical
reasoning, calculated to agitate
voters with constant reminders of
their own mortality. Whether or
not Independents responded, the
rhetoric of death kept the Tea
Party crowd in a persistent state
of panic and rage, ensuring a
standing army ready to fan out to
rallies and town halls at the first
sign of liberal malfeasance.
Obama's first year in office was
marked by more than raucous
protests; there were several
disturbing murders committed by
far-right extremists. In April
2009, a 22-year-old neo-Nazi
wannabe named Richard
Poplawsi mowed down a SWAT
team of Pittsburgh cops, killing
three. Poplawski's best friend told
reporters the young killer ""grew
angry recently over fears Obama
would outlaw guns."" Later it was
discovered that Poplawski had
posted a video clip to a neo-Nazi
Web site portraying Fox's Glenn
Beck contemplating the existence
of concentration camps. (After a
characteristically thorough
investigation, Beck conceded
they were not real.) On another
occasion, the killer posted a video
promoting Tea Party rallies. A
month after the Pittsburgh
bloodbath, Scott Roeder, a
supporter of the militant anti-
abortion group Operation Rescue,

shot Dr. George Tiller to death
while he prayed at his church in
Wichita, Kansas. Tiller was
declared fair game by the anti-
abortion movement because of
his role as Kansas's only late-term
abortion provider. During at least
28 episodes of Bill O'Reilly's
""O'Reilly Factor,"" O'Reilly had
referred to Tiller as ""Tiller the
baby killer,"" a criminal guilty of
""Nazi stuff."" ""I wouldn't want to
be [Tiller] if there is a Judgment
Day,"" O'Reilly proclaimed.
In August 2009, a middle-aged
professional named George
Sodini walked into a health club
in suburban Pittsburgh and
gunned down three women. The
mainstream press explained
Sodini's motives away by homing
in on passages in his online
diaries describing his loneliness,
inability to convince women to
have sex with him, and descent
into chronic masturbation. Nearly
every major media outlet omitted
or ignored a long deranged entry
in which Sodini projected his
sexual frustration onto Obama,
whom he seemed to view as a
symbol of black male virility and
predation.
The day after Obama's election
victory, Sodini wrote: ""Good luck
to Obama! He will be successful.
The liberal media LOVES him.
Amerika has chosen The Black
Man. Good! In light of this I got
ideas outside of Obama's plans
for the economy and such. Here it
is: Every black man should get a
young white girl ... Kinda a
reverse indentured servitude
thing. Every daddy know when
he sends his little girl to college,
she be ... real good. I saw it. 'Not
my little girl', daddy says! (Yeah
right!!) Black dudes have thier

[sic] choice of best white??
[ellipses in original].""
In another posting to an anti-
Clinton forum in 1994, during the
height of the Republicans'
Whitewater investigation, Sodini
revealed that he had purchased a
bumper sticker reading, ""Stop
Socialism, Impeach Clinton,""
from a National Review ad. A
year later, Sodini ranted on an
anti-government militia site, ""I
am convinced that more drastic
action is required to bring the
country back to the Constitutional
order that it was 200 years ago. I
don't think any group of political
leaders will achieve this for us.""
Whether or not Sodini's murder
spree was motivated by his
political passions, he was
pathologically death-driven and
fixated on the phantasmagoria of
right-wing imagery. In his final
diary entry, Sodini proclaimed,
""Death lives!""
More than any other media figure
of the Obama era, Glenn Beck
encouraged the campaign of
racial demonization and
conspiracy that consumed the Tea
Party ""Patriots."" During a
broadcast of ""Fox and Friends,""
Beck opined that Obama ""has
exposed himself over and over
and over again as a guy who has a
deep-seated hatred for white
people, or the white culture."" As
evidence, Beck pointed to White
House green-jobs czar Van Jones,
an African American former
community organizer who was
eventually forced to resign as a
direct result of Beck's crusade.
From there, Beck targeted another
black Obama adviser, Valerie
Jarrett, highlighting her ties to
ACORN while upholding her and
Jones as evidence of Obama's

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770985 Date: 08/31/2015
""socialist"" agenda. In another
broadcast, Beck played an audio
clip of unidentified African
Americans referring to ""Obama
money"" as they collected welfare
checks in Detroit. Then he
showed footage of members of a
Kansas City-based youth group
practicing a step show, a
traditional African-American
group dance apparently
unfamiliar enough to Beck and
his transfixed audience that he
felt at liberty to claim the footage
as evidence that ""Obama's SS""
was being trained across inner-
city America.
In September 2009, Beck
relentlessly targeted ACORN, the
Right's new favorite hobgoblin,
admitting that he intended to use
the poor people's advocacy group
to distract his viewers from the
health care debate. ""Trust me,""
Beck said, ""Everybody now says
they're going to be talking about
health care. I don't think so."" (His
statement was reminiscent of
Rush Limbaugh's scandal-
mongering remark during the
early Clinton administration:
""Whitewater is about health
care."") Beck promptly cued up a
series of hidden camera videos
shot by conservative youth
activists James O'Keefe and
Hannah Giles inside ACORN
field offices. In the videos,
O'Keefe baited African-American
staffers into making statements
explaining that Giles, who
claimed she was a prostitute,
could obtain low-income housing.
O'Keefe edited in images of
himself clad in an outlandish
pimp costume to create the
impression that he was dressed
that way during the meetings with
ACORN; however, Giles later
admitted her partner had lied

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770985 Date: 08/31/2015
about wearing his costume to
farther ineriminate ACORN. In
the end. ACORN was exonerated
of all criminal wrongdoing while
in a separate incident O'Keefe
was arrested and charged with a
federal crime after he and several
conservative pals disguised
themselves as telephone
repairmen and attempted to
wiretap phone lines in the office
of Senator Mary 'Landrieu of
Louisiana. Like Ryan Sorba,
O'Keefe and his posse were
movement cadres paid and
directed by well-funded
conservative outfits; O'Keefe had
been trained by the Leadership
Institute, the right-wing youth
Froup that nurtured leadinG, lights
like Jack Abriunoff, Karl Rove,
Ralph Reed, and Jeff Gannon.
While O'Keefe and his buddies
plea-bargained with prosecutors,
Beck basked in his formula for
success. His show earned the
hithest ratings at Fox News,
topping network franchises like
O'Reilly and Sean Hannity. In the
process. Beck's opinions became
firmly implanted in the nervous
systems of Tea Party activists.
""Glenn Beck has taught us
everything we know,"" a
demonstrator at the 9-12 rally told
Me. ""He's opened our eyes to so
much.""
But unlike the right-wing radio
warhorses who helped usher in
Newt Gin<trich's Republican
counter-revolution of 1994, Beck
was not an authentic product of
the movement. When Rush
Limbaugh first began dominating
the AM airwaves, Beck was
mired in the world of mid-level
commercial radio, delivering
corny yarns about lesbians and
celebrity trash in hopes of

becoming the next Howard Stem.
By night, as he has tirelessly
recounted, he medicated his
anxiety with cocaine and alcohol,
destroying his first marriage in
the process. ""We remember
Glenn from the womanizing, the
drinking, the drugs. Everybody
who knew him at the time saw
what a: complete mess he was,"" a
shock jock from Tampa, Florida,
who called himself Bubba the
Love Sponge remarked to me
during a broadcast of his
nationally syndicated show.
Like Dusty Rhodes, the pseudo-
populist demagogue of Elia
Kazan's 1957 film, A Face in the
Crowd. Beck was a self-
destructive drifter Who might
have been crumpled up with a
bottle of Mad Dog 20/20 in an
alleyway or been locked away in
,a prison cell had fame not found
him first. Beck was only able to
stabilize his life when he made
his escape from freedom.,
marrying a conservative Mormon,
converting to her religion, and
transmuting his urge to abuse
drugs into conservative radio
diatribes. When Beck first broke
into television On CNN's
Headline News Channel, he
struggled to articulate a coherent
political world view. If he
distinguished himself from other
big-time conservative .hosts in
any way, he did so through
strained and often snide attempts
at humor, remnants of his failed
radio career. Nevertheless, with
help"						
from his liberal agent							
Matthew Hiltzik	 Beck snagged a						
primetime slot at Fox News in							
early 2009. Around this same							
time	 Beck began promoting the						
work of an arcane Mormon							
conspiracy-peddler named W.							
Clean Skousen	 whom he						
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770985 Date: 08/31/2015							

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770985 Date: 08/31/2015							
described as his political lodestar.							
Suddenly	 Beck had something						
more to offer than irritable mental							
gestures.							
Thanks to Beck's designation of							
Skousen's pseudohistorical tract							
The 5000 Year Leap as ""required							
reading"" on the Web site of his 9-							
12 Project	 and his promotion of						
the book on his show	 the						
previously obscure Skousen.							
became the Hidden imam of the							
Tea Party movement. By the							
summer of 2009	 Skousen's Leap						
was among the top 10 books on							
Amazon.com and a fixture on							
literature tables at Tea Party							
gatherings. It went from selling a							
puny couple of thousand copies in							
2007 to selling over 200	0						
copies in 2009. Just why the book							
generated such an instant appeal							
is difficult to understand. It is							
little more than a slapdash of							
quotes from the Founding							
Fathers	 often taken out of						
context and deliberately							
oversimplified	 to explain why						
America is the greatest nation in							
history. in the process	 Skousen						
claims that church and state							
separation is un-American	 that						
coercive taxation"" is communist							
and that marriage is the							
underpinning of a free society.							
Benjamin Franklin.	 who wrote at						
length on the merits of ""amours""							
with ""old women	 and who						
famously solicited prostitutes and							
fathered a son of out of wedlock							
was the ultimate authority							
Skousen quoted on the							
importance of marriage.							
Though Skousen claims the							
Founders as the world's foremost							
source of eternal wisdom	 he						
buttressed his points with fringe							
sources like the conspiracist							
Norman Dodd's screeds about the							
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770985 Date: 08/31/2015							

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770985 Date: 08/31/2015							
Illuminati. According. to Skousen							
Dodd claimed that ""powerful							
influences congregating in the							
United States"" like the							
Rockefellers and the Rothschilds							
had forced the United States into							
World War I. Skousen published							
Dodd's manifestoes in his obscure							
journal Freemen's Digest	 which						
he founded for the express							
purpose of propagating							
conspiracies.							
Skousen's paranoid politics were							
an outgrowth of his participation.							
in extreme anti-communist							
groups during the 1950s. He							
boasted of a close friendship with							
then-FBI director J. Edgar							
Hoover and said he provided him							
with research on communist							
plots	 claims disputed by FBI						
historians. (During a recent							
interview. Skousen's son	 Paul						
told me that contrary to rumors of							
Hoover's cross-dressing and							
homosexual dalliances	 he would						
set the top cop up on blind dates							
with live women.) Skousen was							
fired from his job as Salt Lake							
City's police chief for	 in the						
words of the city's conservative							
Mormon mayor	 ""conduct[ing]						
hi.s office as chief of police in							
exactly the same manner in which							
the communists operate their							
government."" From there							
Skousen sailed off to the far							
shores of the Right-peddling							
conspiracy tracts like The Naked							
Communist-	 and earning						
condemnation from his beloved							
FBI	 which accused him in an						
internal memo of ""promoting							
[his] own anti-communism for							
obvious financial purposes.""							
Skousen's vocal support for the							
far-right John Birch Society's							
claim that communists controlled							
President Dwight Eisenhower

cost him the support of the							
corporate backers who had paid							
for his Red-bashing lecture tours.							
He went off the radar for several							
years	 returning during the late						
1960s to accuse the Jewish							
Rothschild family of secretly							
bankrolling everyone from Ho

movement. By the late 1970s							
even the Church of Latter Day							
Saints distanced itself from							
Skousen and his conspiracy							
theories. His work fell through							
the margins and might have							
disappeared entirely had Beck not							
revived it	 turning The 5000 Year						
Leap into the bible of the Tea							
Party movement. Journalist							
Alexander Zaitchik observed in							
his authoritative profile of							
Skousen on Salon.com that							
Skousen's renewed influence							
through Beck and the Tea Party							
'suggests that the modern base of							
the Republican Party is headed to							
a very strange place.""							
Besides influencing Beck							
Skousen's teachings inspired one							
of the Tea Party movement's most							
visible grassroots celebrities							
retired Sheriff Richard Mack. I							
met Mack in February at a far-							
right rally just outside of							
Montgomery	 Alabama. On a						
makeshift stage towed into the							
middle of a rodeo arena by a							
pickup truck	 Mack recalled with						
reverence his mentorship by							
Skousen	 who he said taught him						
everything he needed to know							
about the Constitution. Mack							
urged his spellbound audience to							
stockpile ammo and store food.							
If you control the food supply							
Mack warned	 ""you control the						
people. And that's the first step to							
slavery.""							
Already a hero to conservatives

for successfully suing the Clinton							
administration over the provision							
in the Brady Handgun Violence							
Prevention Act requiring law							
enforcement to conduct criminal							
background checks of gun							
purchasers	 Mack reemerged in						
the Obama era as the archetypal							
local lawman who vowed to resist							
the tyrannical federal							
government. Along with a few							
dozen former and active military							
and law enforcement personnel							
Mack helped form a self-styled							
Tea Party militia called the							
Oathkeepers. Galvanized by their							
fear of creeping socialism	 the						
Oathkeepers solemnly swore to							
refuse tyrannical federal orders							
such as cooperating with foreign							
troops and forcing Americans							
into concentration camps.							
Because the group's members							
trained for combat	 the vow came						
with suggestion of armed							
resistance.							
Besides Mack	 the Oathkeepers						
attracted a coterie of militia							
movement retreads into its ranks.							
The most well-established figure							
was Mike Vanderboegh	 a						
longtime militia fanatic who							
published a booklet in the mid-							
1990s entitled Strategy and							
Tactics for a Militia Civil War							
calling for sniper attacks on ""war							
criminals	 secret policemen	 rats.""					
With Obama in office							
Vandeboegh churned out anti-							
government screeds on right-wing							
blogs with renewed passion and							
supported his efforts by cashing							
in the $1	300 in federal disability						
compensation he received each							
month.							
For all the energy the far right							
exerted in its campaign to							
strangle Obama's agenda	 it was a						
Democrat who posed the greatest

threat to the passage of health							
care reform. Representative Bart							
Stupak of Michigan had been in							
office since 1993	 placing him						
among the senior leadership of							
the so-called centrist Blue Dog							
Democrats. When health care							
reform was introduced in							
Congress	 Stupak became the						
leader of an informal caucus of							
anti-abortion Democrats	 making						
him the de facto swing vote on							
the House version of the bill. By							
extension	 Stupak was the point						
man in the campaign to ensure							
that the bill would not allow							
federal funding for abortion for							
low-income women.							
But after close consultation with							
leaders of the U.S. Conference of							
Catholic Bishops	 Stupak went a						
step further. He introduced a							
draconian amendment to block							
women from paying for abortions							
from even their own private							
insurance plans. The amendment							
which passed the House but was							
shut down in the Senate	 became						
a key sticking point in health care							
negotiations. 'He's a big hero							
now in the pro-life community							
former Bush Catholic issues							
adviser Deal Hudson told me in							
November 2009. ""Thanks to him							
this is the first time I can							
remember the pro-life Democrats							
having any power.""							
To the chagrin of the							
Republicans	 Stupak entertained						
offers of compromise from the							
Democratic leadership.							
According to Hudson	 the						
Catholic Bishops were keen to							
see health care reform pass	 but						
only if the bill contained a clear							
provision forbidding patients							
from spending federal money on							
abortion. Finally	 in March	 after					
pressure from House Majority

Leader Nancy Pelosi	 Obam.a						
agreed to sign an executive order							
forbidding the federal funding of							
abortion. Stupak had been							
mollified. Now he and his anti-							
abortion caucus pledged to							
deliver the swing votes the							
Democrats needed to pass the							
bill. As soon as reports seeped out							
declaring the imminent passage							
of health care reform	 major						
right-wing blogs like							
RedState.org churned out virulent							
denunciations of Stupak	 calling						
him a traitor and sellout. The blog							
comment sections filled up with							
dozens of diatribes referring to							
Stupak in language previously							
reserved for Dr. George Tiller:							
Bart the Baby-Killer.""							
On March 20	 thousands of Tea						
Party activists surrounded the							
Capitol's Longworth Building in							
expectation of Obama's pep talk							
to the House Democrats and the							
health care vote. Democratic							
Representative john Lewis	 a						
hero of the civil rights movement							
and Representative Barney Frank							
the first openly gay member of							
Congress	 passed through the						
crowd on their way inside the							
Capitol. Thsligger!"" a demonstrator							
barked at Lewis. Another called							
Frank a ""faggot	 eliciting						
laughter and cheers from nearby							
protesters. Meanwhile	 as another						
African-American Democrat							
Representative Emanuel Cleaver							
ascended the Capitol steps	 a						
protester who had been screaming							
at Lewis and Frank spat on his							
face.							
With the demonstration carried							
on into the night	 cries of ""Kill						
the bill!'' drifted into calls for							
violence. ""I would gladly stand							
with any of you men here and							
take these fascists down	 a man

uniform proclaimed in front of an							
amateur videographer	 pointing						
toward the Capitol. ""You haven't							
heard the last of me!""							
The next day	 Republican						
members of Congress emerged							
from the Longworth Building to							
salute the Tea Partiers. The							
demonstrators cheered wildly for							
their proxies on the inside.							
Finally	 after hours of						
impassioned speeches on the							
House floor	 the bill passed. But						
the drama was hardly over.							
Republican Representative Joe							
Pitts	 an anti-abortion Catholic						
who co-authored Stupak's							
original amendment	 demanded a						
motion to bring it back to the							
floor for a vote	 a transparent						
exercise in grandstanding that							
was certain to fail. In response							
Stupak rushed to the podium with							
a stinging rebuke to Pitts and the							
Republicans. ""The motion to							
commit does not support life							
Stupak declared. ""It is the							
Democrats who have stood up....""							
Heckling from the Republican							
side interrupted his statement. As							
Stupak looked around the House							
chamber	 Rep. Randy						
Neugebauer	 a right-wing						
Republican from Texas who							
openly supported the Birther							
movement	 began shouting at him						
from the backbench	 ""Baby						
killer!"" Other Republicans joined							
in	 parroting base insults.						
While the Republicans sank their							
heads in defeat	 some more						
militant devotees of the Tea Party							
movement called for a right-wing							
Kristallnacht. ""If you wish to

her party cannot fail to hear

after the bill passed. ""Break them

windows and doors at Democratic							
Party headquarters in New York							
Kansas and Arizona had been							
shattered.							
Meanwhile	 at least 10						
Democratic members of Congress							
reported receiving death threats.							
Images of nooses were faxed to							
the offices of Stupak and James							
Clyburn	 an African-American						
congressman from South							
Carolina. Representative Anthony							
Weiner	 an especially vocal						
proponent of health care reform							
received a menacing letter filled							
with white powder. The brother							
of Representative Torn Perriello							
another health care supporter	 had						
his home gas line deliberately							
sabotaged after a local Tea Party							
organizer posted his address							
online (he had meant to post the							
congressman's) and encouraged							
activists to ""drop by"" to express							
their anger about Perriello's							
recent vote. In Tucson	 Arizona						
the windows of Democratic							
Representative Gabrielle

shots from a pellet gun. And a							
brick was thrown through the							
window of Representative Louise							
Slaughter's office in New York as							
her voicemail filled with threats							
of impending sniper attacks.							
After the Passage of the health							
care bill	 the Tea Party floated						
into a gray zone between							
authoritarianism and anarchy.

order	 they promoted disorder.

vice-president of the company and the C.E.O. of its Chemical Technology Group. A							
financial expert who knows Koch Industries well told me	 ""Charles is the						
company. Charles runs ."" David	 described by associates as ""affable"" and ""a						
bit of a lunk	 enjoyed for years the life of a wealthy bachelor. He rented a						
yacht in the South of France and bought a waterfront home in Southampton	 where						
he threw parties that the Web site New York Social Diary likened to an ""East

donations	 they contrived to place David on the ticket	 in the Vice-Presidential

slot; upon becoming a candidate	 he could lavish as much of his personal fortune

as he wished on the campaign. The ticket's slogan was ""The Libertarian Party has							
only one source of funds: You."" In fact	 its primary source of funds was David						
Koch	 who spent more than two million dollars on the effort.						
Many of the ideas propounded in the 1980 campaign presaged the Tea Party							
movement. Ed Clark told The Nation that libertarians were getting ready to stage							
a very big tea party	 because people were ""sick to death"" of taxes. The						
Libertarian Party platform called for the abolition of the F.B.I. and the							
° .C.I.A.	 as well as of federal regulatory agencies	 such as the Securities and					
Exchange Commission and the Department of Energy. The Party wanted to end Social							
Security	 minimum-wage laws	 gun control	 and all personal and corporate income				
taxes; it proposed the legalization of prostitution	 recreational drugs	 and					
suicide. Government should be reduced to only one function: the protection of							
individual rights. William F. Buckley	 Jr.	 a more traditional conservative					
called the movement ""Anarcho-Totalitarianism.""							
That November	. the Libertarian ticket received only one per cent of the vote.						
The brothers realized that their brand of politics didn't sell at the ballot							
box. Charles Koch became openly scornful of conventional politics. •""It tends to							
be a nasty	 corrupting business	 he told a reporter at the time. ""I'm					
interested in advancing libertarian ideas."" According to Doherty's book	 the						
Kochs came to regard elected politicians as merely ""actors playing out a							
script."" A longtime confidant of the Kochs told Doherty that the brothers wanted

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015							
to ""supply the themes and words for the scripts."" In order to alter the							
direction of America	 they had to ""influence the areas where policy ideas						
percolate from: academia and think tanks.""							
fter the 1980 election	 Charles and David Koch receded from the public arena.						
But they poured more than a hundred million dollars into dozens of seemingly							
independent organizations. Tax records indicate that in 2008 the three main Koch							
family foundations gave money to thirty-four political and policy organizations							
three of which they founded	 and several of which they direct. The Kochs and						
their company have given additional millions to political campaigns	 advocacy						
groups	 and lobbyists. The family's subterranean financial role has fuelled						
suspicion on the 'left; Lee Fang	 of the liberal blog ThinkProgress	 has called					
the Kochs ""the billionaires behind the hate.""							
Only the Kochs know precisely how much they have Spent on politics. Public tax							
records show that between 1998 and 2008 the Charles G. Koch Charitable							
Foundation spent more than forty-eight million dollars. The Claude R. Lambe							
Charitable Foundation	 which is controlled by Charles Koch and his slife	 along					
with two company employees and an accountant	 spent more than twenty-eight						
million. The David H. Koch Charitable Foundation spent more than a hundred and							
twenty million. Meanwhile	 since 1998 Koch Industries has spent more than fifty						
million dollars. on lobbying. Separately	 the company's political-action						
committee	 KochPAC	 has donated some eight million dollars to political					
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015							

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015							
campaigns	 more than eighty per cent of it to Republicans. So far in 2010	 Koch					
Industries leads all other energy companies in political contributions	 as it						
has since 2006. In addition	 during the past dozen years the Kochs and other						
family members have personally spent more than two million dollars on political							
contributions. In the second quarter of 2010	 David Koch was the biggest						
individual contributor to the Republican Governors Association	 with a						
million-dollar donation. Other gifts by the Koons may be untraceable; federal							
tax law permits anonymous personal donations to politically active nonprofit							
groups.							
In recent decades	 members of several industrial dynasties have spent parts of						
their fortunes on a conservative agenda. In the nineteen-eighties	 the Olin						
family	 which owns a chemicals-and-manufacturing conglomerate	 became known for					
funding right-leaning thinking in academia	 particularly in law schools. And						
during the nineties Richard Mellon Scaife	 a descendant of Andrew Mellon	 spent					
millions attempting to discredit President Bill Clinton. An Rabin-Havt							
vice-president at the Democratic-leaning Web site Media Matters	 said that the						
Kochs' effort is unusual	 in its marshalling of corporate and personal funds:						
Their role	 in terms of financial commitments	 is staggering.""					
Of course	 Democrats give money	 too. Their most prominent donor	 the financier				
George Soros	 runs a foundation	 the Open Society Institute	 that has spent as				
much as a hundred million dollars a year in America. Soros has also made							
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015							

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015							
generous private contributions to various Democratic campaigns	 including						
Obamas. But Michael Vachon	 his spokesman	 argued that Soros's giving is					
transparent	 and that ""none of his contributions are in the service of his own						
economic interests."" The Kochs have given millions of dollars to nonprofit							
groups that criticize environmental regulation and support lower taxes for							
industry. Gus diZerega	 the former friend	 suggested that the Kochs' youthful					
idealism about libertarianism had largely devolved into a rationale for							
corporate self-interest. He said of Charles	 ""Perhaps he has confused making						
money with freedom.""							
Some critics have suggested that the Kochs' approach has subverted the purpose							
of tax-exempt giving. By law	 charitable foundations must conduct exclusively						
nonpartisan activities that promote the public welfare. A 2004 report by the							
National Committee for *Responsive Philanthropy	 a watchdog group	 described the					
*Kochs' foundations as being self-serving	 concluding	 ""These foundations give					
money to nonprofit organizations that do research and advocacy on issues that							
impact the profit margin of Koch Industries.""							
The Kochs have gone well beyond their immediate self-interest	 however	 funding					
'organizations that aim to push the country in a libertarian direction. Among the							
institutions that they have subsidized are the Institute for Justice	. which						
files lawsuits opposing state and federal regulations; the Institute for Humane							
Studies	 which underwrites libertarian academics; and the Bill of Rights						
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015							

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015							
Institute	 which promotesa conservative slant on the Constitution. Many of the						
organizations funded by the Kochs employ specialists who write position papers							
that are subsequently quoted by politicians and pundits. David Koch has							
acknowledged that the family exerts tight ideological control. ""If we're going							
to give a lot of money	 we'll make darn sure they spend it in a way that goes						
along with our intent	 he told Doherty. ""And if they make a wrong turn and						
start doing things we don't agree with	 we withdraw funding.""						
he Kochs' subsidization of a pro-corporate movement fulfills	 in many ways	 the					
.vision laid out in a secret 1971 memo that Lewis Powell	 then a Virginia						
attorney	 wrote two months before he was nominated to the Supreme Court. The						
antiwar movement had turned its anger on defense contractors	 such as Dow						
Chemical	 and Ralph Nader was leading a public-interest crusade against						
corporations. Powell	 writing- a report for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce	 urged					
American companies to fight back. The greatest threat to free enterprise	 he						
warned	 was not Communism or the New Left but	 rather	 respectable elements of				
soCiety""—intellectuals	 journalists	 and scientists. To defeat them	 he wrote				
business leaders needed to wage a long-term	 unified campaign to change public						
opinion.							
Charles Koch seems to have approached both business and politics with the							
deliberation of an engineer. ""To bring about social change	 he told Doherty						
requires ""a strategy"" that is ""vertically and horizontally integrated	 spanning						
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015							

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015							
from idea creation to policy development to education to grassroots							
organizations to lobbying to litigation to political action."" The project	 he						
admitted	 was extremely ambitious. ""We have a radical philosophy	 he said.					
In 1977	 the Kochs provided the funds to launch the nation's first libertarian						
think tank	 the Cato Institute. According to the Center for Public Integrity						
between 1986 and 1993 the Koch family gave eleven million dollars to the							
institute. Today	 Cato has more than a hundred full-time employees	 and its					
experts and policy papers are widely quoted and respected by the mainstream							
media. It describes itself as nonpartisan	 and its scholars have at times been						
critical of both parties. Put it has consistently pushed for corporate tax cuts							
reductions in social services	 and laissez-faire environmental policies.						
When President Obama	 in a 2008 speech	 described the science on global warming					
as ""beyond dispute	 the Cato Institute took out a full-page ad in the Times to						
contradict him. Cato's resident scholars have relentlessly criticized political							
attempts to stop global warming as expensive	 ineffective	 and unnecessary. Ed					
Crane	 the Cato Institute's founder and president	 told me that ""global-warming					
theories give the government more control of the economy.""							
Cato scholars have been particularly energetic in promoting the Climategate							
scandal. Last year	 private e-mails of climate scientists at the University of						
East Anglia	 in England	 were mysteriously leaked	 and their exchanges appeared				
to suggest a willingness to falsify data in order to buttress the idea that							
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015							

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015							
global warming is real. In the two weeks after the e-mails went public	 one Cato						
scholar gave more than twenty media interviews trumpeting the alleged scandal.							
But five independent inquiries have since exonerated the researchers	 and						
nothing was found in their e-mails or data to discredit the scientific consensus							
on global warming.							
Nevertheless	 the controversy succeeded in spreading skepticism about climate						
change. Even though the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently							
issued a report concluding that the evidence for global warming is unequivocal							
more Americans are convinced than at any time since 1997 that scientists have							
exaggerated the seriousness of global warming. The Kochs promote this statistic							
on their company's Web site but do not mention the role that their funding has							
played in fostering such doubt.							
In a 2002 memo; the Republican political consultant Frank Luntz wrote that.so							
long as ""voters believe there is no consensus about global warming within the							
scientific community"" the status quo would prevail. The key for opponents of							
environmental reform	 he said	 was to question the science—a public-relations					
strategy that the tobacco industry used effectively for years to forestall							
regulation. The Kochs have funded many sources of environmental Skepticism	 such						
as the Heritage Foundation	 which has argued that ""scientific facts gathered in						
the past 10 years do not support the notion of catastrophic human-made warming.""							
The brothers have given money to more obscure groups	 too	 such as the					
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015							

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015							
Independent Women's Forum	 which opposes the presentation of global warming as a						
scientific fact in American public schools. Until 2008	 the group was run by						
Nancy Pfotenhauer	 a former lobbyist for Koch Industries. Mary Beth Jarvis	 a					
vice-president of a Koch subsidiary	 is on the group's board.						
Naomi Oreskes	 a professor of history and science studies at the University of						
California	 San Diego	 is the co-author of ""Merchants of Doubt	 a new book that				
chronicles various attempts by American industry to manipulate public opinion on							
science. She noted that the Mocha	 as the heads of ""a company with refineries						
and pipelines	 have ""a lot at. stake."" She added	 ""If the answer is to phase out					
fossil fuels	 a different group of people are going to be making money	 so we					
shouldn't be surprised that they're fighting tooth and nail.""							
David Koch told New York that he was unconvinced that global warming has been							
caused by human activity. Even if it has been	 h said	 the heating of the					
planet will be beneficial	 resulting in longer growing seasons in the Northern						
Hemisphere. ""The Earth will be able to support enormously more peoplebecause							
far greater land area will be available to produce food	 he said.						
n the mid-eighties	 the Kochs provided millions of dollars to George Mason						
University	 in Arlington	 Virginia	 to set up another think tank. Now known as				
the Mercatus Center	 it promotes itself as ""the world's premier university.						
source for market-oriented ideas—bridging the gap betWeen. academic ideas and							
teal-world problems."" Financial records show that the Koch family foundations							
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015							

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015							
have contributed more than thirty million dollars to George Mason	 much of which						
has gone to the Mercatus Center	 a nonprofit organization. ""It's ground zero for						
deregulation.policy in Washington	 Rob Stein	 the Demodratic strategist	 said.				
It is an unusual arrangement. ""George Mason is a public university	 and receives						
public funds	 Stein noted. ""Virginia is hosting an institution• that the Kochs						
practically control.""							
The founder of the Mercatus Center is Richard Fink	 formerly an economist. Fink						
heads Koch Industries' lobbying operation in Washington. In addition	 he is the						
president of the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation	 the president of the						
Claude R. Lambe Charitable Foundation	 a director of the Fred C. and Mary R.						
Koch Foundation	 and a director and co-founder	 with David Koch	 of the				
Americans for Prosperity Foundation.							
Fink	 with his many titles	 has become the central nervous system of the					
Kochtopus. He appears to have supplanted Ed Crane	 the 'head or the Cato						
Institute	 as the brothers' main political lieutenant. Though David remains on						
the board at Cato	 Charles Koch has fallen out with Crane. Associates suggested						
to me that Crane had been insufficiently respectful of Charles's management							
philosophy	 which he distilled into a book called ""The Science of Success	 and					
trademarked under the name Market-Based Management	 or M.B.M. In the book						
Charles recommends instilling a company's corporate culture with the							
competitiveness of the marketplace. Koch describes M.B.M. as a ""holistic system""

containing ""five dimensions: vision	 virtue and talents	 knowledge.processes					
decision rights and incentives."" A top Cato Institute official told me that							
Charles ""thinks he's a genius. He's the emperor	 and he's convinced he's wearing						
clothes."" Fink	 by contrast	 has been .far more embracing of Charles's ideas.					
(Fink	 like the Kochs	 declined to be interviewed.)					
At a 1995 conference for philanthropists	 Fink adopted the language of economics						
when speaking about the Mercatus Center's purpose. He said that grant-makers							
should use think tanks and political-action groups to convert intellectual raw							
materials into policy ""products.""							
The Wall Street Journal has called the Mercatus Center ""the mos.t important think							
tank you've never heard of	 and noted that fourteen of the twenty-three						
regulations that President George W. Bush placed on a ""hit list"" had been							
suggested first by Mercatus scholars. Fink told the paper that the Kochs have							
other means of fighting [their] battles	 and that the Mercatus Center does not						
actively promote the company's private interests. But Thomas McGarity	 a law						
professor at the University of Texas	 who specializes in environmental issues	.					
told me that ""Koch has been constantly in trouble with the E.P.A.	 and Mercatus						
has constantly hammered on the agency."" An environmental lawyer who has clashed							
with the Mercatus Center called it ""a means of laundering economic aims."" The							
lawyer explained the strategy: ""You take corporate money and give it to a							
neutral-sounding think tank	 which ""hires people with pedigrees and academic

degrees who put out credible-seeming studies. But they all coincide perfectly							
with the economic interests of their funders.""							
In 1997	 for instance	 the E.P.A. moved to reduce surface ozone	 a form of				
pollution caused	 in part	 by emissions from oil refineries. Susan Dudley	 an				
economist. who became a top official at the Mercatus Center	 criticized the						
proposed							
. rule. The E.P.A.	 she argued	 had not taken into account that smog-free					
skies would result in more cases of skin cancer. She projected that if pollution							
were controlled it would cause up to eleven thousand additional cases of skin							
cancer each year.							
In 1999	 the District of Columbia Circuit Court took up Dudley's smog argument.						
Evaluating the E.P.A.rule	 the court found that the E.P.A. had ""explicitly						
disregarded"" the ""possible health benefits of ozone."" In another part of the							
opinion	 the court ruled	 2-1	 that the E.P.A. had overstepped its authority in				
calibrating standards for ozone emissions. As the Constitutional Accountability							
Center	 a think tank	 revealed	 the judges in the majority had previously				
attended legal junkets	 on a Montana ranch	 that were arranged by the Foundation					
for Research on Economics and the Environment—a group funded by Koch family							
foundations. The judges have claimed that the ruling was unaffected by their							
attendance.							
deas don't happen on their own	 Matt Kibbe	 the president of FreedomWorks	 a				
Tea Party advocacy group	 told me. ""Throughout history	 ideas need patrons."" The

Koch brothers	 after helping to create Cato and Mercatus	 concluded that think					
tanks alone were not enough to effect change. They needed a mechanism to deliver							
those ideas to the street	 and•to attract the public's support. In 1984	 David					
Koch and Richard Fink created yet another organization	 and Kibbe joined them.						
The group	 Citizens for a Sound Economy	 seemed like a grassroots movement	 but				
according to the Center for Public Integrity it was sponsored principally by the							
Kochs	 who provided $7.9 million between 1986 and 1993. Its mission	 Kibbe said					
was to take these heavy ideas and translate them for mass America. . . . We							
read the same literature Obama did about nonviolent revolutions—Saul Alinsky							
Gandhi	 Martin Luther King. We studied the idea of the Boston Tea Party as an						
example of nonviolent	 social change. We learned we needed boots on the ground to						
sell ideas	 not candidates."" Within a few years	 the group had mobilized fifty					
paid field workers	 in twenty-six states	 to rally voters behind the Kochs'					
agenda. David and Charles	 according to one participant	 were ""very controlling					
very top down. You can't build an organization with them. They run it.""							
Around this time	 the brothers faced a political crisis. In 1989	 the Senate					
Select Committee on Indian Affairs investigated their business and released a							
scathing report accusing Koch Oil of ""a widespread and sophisticated scheme to							
steal crude oil from Indians and others through fraudulent mismeasuring."" The							
Kochs admitted that they had improperly taken thirty-one million dollars' worth							
of crude oil	 but said that it had been accidental. Charles Koch told committee •

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015							
investigators that oil measurement is ""a very uncertain art.""							
To defend its reputation	 Koch Industries hired Robert Strauss	 then a premier					
Washington lobbyist; the company soon opened an office in the city. A grand jury							
was convened to investigate the allegations	 but it eventually disbanded						
without issuing criminal charges. According to the Senate report	 after the						
committee hearings Koch operatives delved into the personal lives of committee							
staffers	 even questioning an ex-wife. Senate investigators were upset by the						
Kochs' tactics. Kenneth Ballen	 the counsel to the Senate committee	 said					
These people have amassed such unaccountable power!""							
By 1993	 when Bill Clinton became President	 Citizens for a Sound Economy had					
become a prototype for the kind of corporate-backed opposition campaigna that							
have proliferated during the Obama era. The group waged a successful assault on							
Clinton's proposed B.T.U. tax on energy	 for instance	 running- advertisements					
staging media events	 and targeting opponents. And it mobilized anti-tax rallies						
outside the Capitol-rallies that NPR described as ""designed to strike fear into							
the hearts of wavering Democrats."" ban Glickman	 a former Democratic congressman						
from Wichita	 who supported the B.T.U. tax	 recalled	 ""I'd been in Congress				
eighteen years. The Kochs actually engaged against me and funded my opponent.							
They used a lot of resources and effort-their employees	 too."" Glickman suffered						
a surprise defeat. ""I can't prove it	 but I think I was probably their victim						
he said.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015							
The Kochs continued to disperse their money	 creating slippery organizations						
with generic-sounding names	 and this made it difficult to ascertain the extent						
of their influence in Washington. In 1990	 Citizens for a Sound Economy created						
a spinoff group	 Citizens for the Environment	 which called acid rain and other					
environmental problems ""myths."" When the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette investigated							
the matter	 it discovered that the spinoff group had ""no citizen membership of						
its own.""							
In 1997	 another Senate investigation began looking into what a minority report						
called ""an audacious plan to pour millions of dollars in contributions into -							
Republican campaigns nationwide without disclosing the amount or source	 in						
order to evade .campaign-finance laws. A shell corporation	 Triad Management	 had					
paid more than three million dollars for attack ads in twenty-six House races							
and three Senate races. More than half of the advertising money came from an							
obscure nonprofit group	 the Economic Education Trust. The Senate committee's						
minority report suggested that ""the trust was financed in whole or in part by							
Charles and David Koch of Wichita	 Kansas."" The brothers were suspected of						
having secretly paid for the attack ads	 most of which aired in states where						
Koch Industries did business. In Kansas	 where Triad Management was especially						
active	 the funds may have played a decisive role in four of six federal races.						
The Kochs	 when asked by reporters if they had given the money	 refused to					
comment. In 1998	 however	 the Wall Street Journal confirmed that a consultant

on the Kochs' payroll had been involved in the scheme. Charles Lewis	 of the						
Center for Public Integrity	 described the scandal as ""historic. Triad was the						
first time a major corporation used a cutout""—a front operation—""in a							
threatening way. Koch Industries was the poster child of a company run amok.""							
uring the Clinton Administration	 the energy industry faced increased scrutiny						
and regulation. In the mid-nineties	 the Justice Department filed two lawsuits						
against Koch Industries	 claiming that it was responsible for more than three						
hundred oil spills	 which had released an estimated three million gallons of oil						
into lakes and rivers. The penalty was potentially as high as two hundred and							
fourteen million dollars. In a settlement	 Koch Industries paid a record						
thirty-million-dollar civil fine	 and agreed to spend five million dollars on						
environmental projects.							
In 1999	 a jury found Koch Industries guilty of negligence and malice in the						
deaths of two Texas teen-agers in an explosion that resulted from a leaky							
underground butane pipeline. (In 2001	 the company paid an undisclosed						
settlement.) And in the final months of the Clinton Presidency the Justice							
Department levelled a ninety-seven-count indictment against the company	 for						
covering up the discharge of ninety-one tons of benzene	 a carcinogen	 from its					
refinery in Corpus Christi	 Texas. The company was liable for three hundred and						
fifty million dollars in fines	 and four Koch employees faced up to thirty-five						
years in prison. The Koch Petroleum Group eventually pleaded guilty to one

criminal charge of covering up environmental violations	 including the						
falsification of documents	 and paid a twenty-million-dollar fine. David						
Uhlmann	 a career prosecutor who	 at the time	 headed the environmental-crimes				
section at the Justice Department	 described the suit as ""one of the most						
significant cases ever brought under the Clean Air Act."" He added							
Environmental crimes are almost always motivated by economics and arrogance							
and in the Koch case there was a healthy dose of both.""							
During the 2000 election campaign	 Koch Industries spent some nine hundred						
thousand dollars to support the candidacies of George N. Bush and other							
Republicans. During the Bush years	 Koch Industries and other fossil-fuel						
companies enjoyed remarkable prosperity. The 2005 energy bill	 which Hillary						
Clinton dubbed the Dick Cheney Lobbyist Energy Bill	 offered enormous subsidies						
and tax breaks for energy companies. The Kochs have cast themselves as deficit							
hawks	 but	 according to a study by Media Matters	 their companies have				
benefitted from nearly a hundred million dollars in government contracts since							
2000							
In 2004	 Citizens for a Sound Economy was accused of illegitimately throwing its						
weight behind Bush's reelection. The group's Oregon branch had attempted to get							
Ralph Nader on the Presidential ballot	 in order to dilute Democratic support						
for John Kerry	 Critics argued that it was illegal for a tax-exempt nonprofit						
organization to donate its services for partisan political purposes. (A

complaint was filed with the Federal Election Commission; it was dismissed.)							
That year	 internal rivalries at Citizens for a Sound Economy caused the						
organization to split apart. David Koch and Fink started a new group	 Americans						
for Prosperity	 and they hired Tim Phillips to run it. Phillips was a political						
veteran who had worked with Ralph Reed	 the evangelical leader and Republican						
activist	 co-founding Century Strategies	 a campaign-consulting company that					
became notorious for its ties to the disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff.							
Phillips's online biography describes him as an expert in ""grasstops"" and							
grassroots"" political organizing. The Kochs' choice of Phillips signalled an							
even greater toughness. The conservative operative Grover Norquist	 who is known						
for praising ""throat slitters"" in politics	 called Phillips ""a grownup who can						
make things happen.""							
Last year	 Phillips told the Financial Times that Americans for Prosperity had						
only eight thousand registered members. Currently	 its Web site claims that the						
group has ""1.2 million activists."" Whatever its size	 the Kochs' political						
involvement has been intense; a former employee of the Cato Institute told me							
that Americans for Prosperity ""was micromanaged by the Kochs."" And the brothers'							
investment may well have paid off: Americans for Prosperity	 in concert with the						
•							
family's other organizations	 has been instrumental in disrupting the Obama						
Presidency.							
In January	2008	 Charles Koch wrote in his company newsletter that America					
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015							

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015							
could be on the verge of ""the greatest loss of liberty and prosperity since the							
1930s."" That October	 Americans for Prosperity held a conference of conservative						
operatives at a Marriott hotel outside Washington. Erick Erickson	 the						
editor-in-chief of the conservative blog RedState.com	 took the lectern	 thanked					
David Koch	 and vowed to ""unite and fight . . . the armies of the left!"" Soon						
after Obama assumed office	 Americans for Prosperity launched ""Porkulus"" rallies						
against Obama's stimulus-spending measures. Then the Mercatus Center released a							
report claiming that stimulus funds had been directed disproportionately toward							
Democratic districts; eventually	 the author was forced to correct the report						
but not before Rush Limbaugh	 citing the paper	 had labelled Obama's program ""a					
slush fund	 and Fox News and other conserVative outlets had echoed the						
sentiment. (Phil Kerpen	 the vice-president for policy at Americans for						
Prosperity	 is a contributor to the Fox News Web site. Another officer at						
Americans for Prosperity	 Walter Williams	 often guest-hosts for Limbaugh.)					
Americans for Prosperity also created an offshoot	 Patients United Now	 which					
organized what Phillips has estimated to be more than three hundred rallies							
against health-care reform. At one rally	 an effigy of a Democratic congressman						
was hung; at another	 protesters unfurled a banner depicting corpses from						
Dachau. The group also helped organize the ""Kill the Bill"" protests outside the							
Capitol	 in March	 where Democratic supporters of health-care reform alleged					
that they were spat on and cursed at. Phillips was a featured speaker.							
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015							

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015							
Americans for Prosperity has held at least eighty events targeting cap-and-trade							
legislation	 which is aimed at making industries pay for the air pollution that						
they create. Speakers for -the group claimed		 with exaggeration	 that even				
back-yard barbecues and kitchen stoves would be taxed. The group was also							
involved in the attacks on Obama's ""green jobs"" czar	 Van Jones	 and waged a					
crusade against international climate talks. Casting his group as a champion of							
ordinary workers who would be hurt by environmentalists	 Phillips went to						
Copenhagen last year and staged a protest outside the United Nations conference							
on climate change	 declaring	 ""We're a grasaroots organization. . . . I think					
it's unfortunate when wealthy children of wealthy							
. families . . want to send							
unemployment rates in the United States up to twenty per cent.""							
Grover Norquist	 who holds a weekly meeting for conservative leaders in						
Washington	 .including representatives from Americans for Prosperity	 told me					
that last summer's raucous rallies were pivotal in undermining Obama's agenda							
The Republican leadership in Congress	 he said	 ""couldn't have done it without					
August	 when people went out on the streets. It discouraged deal-makers""—Republicans						
who might otherwise have worked constructively with Obama. Moreover	 the						
appearance of growing public opposition to Obama affected corporate donors on K							
Street. ""K Street is a three-billion-dollar weathervane	 Norquist said. ""When						
Obama was 'strong	 the Chamber of Commerce said	 'We can work with the Obama					
Administration.' But that changed when thousands of people went into the street							
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015							

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015							
and 'terrorized' congressmen. August is what changed it. Now that Obama is weak							
people are getting tough.""							
As the first anniversary of Obama's election approached	 David Koch came to the						
Washington area to attend a triumphant Americans for Prosperity gathering.							
Obama's poll numbers were falling fast. Not a single Republican senator was							
working with the Administration on health care	 or much else. Pundits were						
writing about Obama's political ineptitude	 and Tea Party groups were accusing						
the President of initiating ""a government takeover."" In a speech	 Koch said						
Days like today bring to reality the vision of our board of directors when we							
started this organization	 five years ago."" He went on	 ""We envisioned a mass					
movement	 a state-based one	 but national in scope	 of hundreds of thousands of				
American citizens from all walks of life standing up and fighting for the							
economic freedoms that made our nation the most prosperous society in history. .							
. . Thankfully	 the stirrings from California to Virginia	 and from Texas to					
Michigan	 show that more and more of our fellow-citizens are beginning to see						
the same truths as we do.""							
While Koch didn't explicitly embrace the Tea Party movement that day	 more						
recently he has come close to doing so	 praising it for demonstrating the						
powerful visceral hostility in the body politic against the massive increase in							
government power	 the massive efforts to socialize this country."" Charles Koch						
in a newsletter sent to his seventy thousand employees	 compared the Obama

Administration to the regime of the Venezuelan strongman Hugo Chavez. The Kochs'							
sense of imperilment is somewhat puzzling. Income inequality in America is							
greater than it has been since the nineteen-twenties	 and since the seventies						
the tax rates of the wealthiest have fallen more than thoseof the middle class.							
Yet the brothers' message has evidently resonated with-voters: a recent poll							
found that fifty-five per cent of Americans agreed that Obama is a socialist.							
Americans for Prosperity	 meanwhile	 has announced that it will spend an					
additional forty-five million dollars before the midterm elections	 in November.						
Although the group is legally prohibited from directly .endorsing candidates	 it						
nonetheless plans to target some fifty House races and half a dozen Senate							
races	 staging rallies	 organizing door-to-door canvassing	 and running ads				
aimed at ""educating voters about where candidates stand.""							
Though the Kochs have slowed Obama's momentum	 their larger political battle is						
far from won. Richard Fink	 interviewed by FrumForum.com this spring	 said	 ""If				
you look at where we've gone from the year 2000 to now	 with the expansion of						
government spending and a debt burden that threatens to bankrupt the country							
doesn't look very good at all."" He went on	 ""It looks like the infrastructure						
that was built and nurtured has not carried the. day."" He suggested that the							
Kochs needed ""to get more into the practical	 day-to-day issues of governing.""						
n 1991	 David Koch was badly injured in a plane crash in Los Angeles. He was the						
sole passenger in first class to survive. As he was recovering	 a routine						
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015

physical exam led to the discovery of prostate cancer. Koch received treatment							
settled down	 started a family	 and reconsidered his life. As he told Portfolio					
When you're the only one who survived in the front of the plane and everyone							
else died—yeah	 you think	 'My God	 the good Lord soared me for some greater				
purpose.' My joke is that I've been busy ever since	 doing all the good work I						
can think of	 so He can have confidence in me.""						
Koch began giving spectacularly large donations to the arts and sciences. And he							
became a patron of cancer research	 focussing on prostate cancer. In addition to						
his gifts to Sloan-Kettering	 he gave fifteen million dollars to New						
York-Presbyterian Hospital	 a hundred and twenty-five million to M.I.T. for						
cancer research	 twenty million to Johns Hopkins University	 and twenty-five					
millior. to the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center	 in Houston. In response to his						
generosity	 Sloan-Kettering gave Koch its Excellence in Corporate Leadership						
Award. In 2004	 President Bush named him to the National Cancer Advisory Board						
which guides the National Cancer Institute.							
Koch's corporate and political roles	 however	 may pose conflicts of interest.					
For example	 at the same time that David Koch has been casting himself as a						
champion in the fight against cancer	 Koch Industries has been lobbying to						
prevent the E.P.A. from classifying formaldehyde	 which the company produces in						
great quantities	 as a ""known carcinogen"" in humans.						
Scientists have long known that formaldehyde causes cancer in rats	 and several						
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015							

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015							
major scientific studies have concluded that formaldehyde causes cancer in human							
beings—including one published last year by the National Cancer Institute	 on						
whose advisory board Koch. sits. The study tracked twenty-five thousand patients							
for an average of forty years; subjects exposed to higher amounts of							
formaldehyde had significantly higher rates of leukemia. These results helped							
lead an expert panel within the National Institutes of Health to conclude that							
formaldehyde should be categorized as a known carcinogen	 and be strictly						
controlled by the government. Corporations have resisted regulations on							
formaldehyde for decades	 however	 and Koch Industries has been a large funder					
of members of Congress who have stymied the E.P.A.	 requiring it to defer new						
regulations until more studies are completed.							
Koch Industries became a major producer of the chemical in 2005	 after it bought						
Georgia-Pacific	 the paper and wood-products company	 for twenty-one billion					
dollars. Georgia-Pacific manufactures formaldehyde in its chemical division	 and						
uses it to produce various wood products	 such as plywood and laminates. Its						
annual production capacity for formaldehyde is 2.2 billion pounds. Last							
December	 Traylor Champion	 Georgia-Pacific's vice-president of environmental					
affairs	 sent a formal letter of protest to federal health authorities. He wrote						
that the company ""	strongly disagrees"" with the N.I.H. panel's conclusion that						
formaldehyde should be treated as a known human carcinogen. David Koch did not							
recuse himself from the National Cancer Advisory Board	 or divest himself of

company stock	 while his company was directly lobbying the government to keep						
formaldehyde on the market. (A board spokesperson said that the issue of							
formaldehyde had not come up.)							
James Huff	 an associate director at the National institute for Environmental						
Health Sciences	 a division of the N.I.H.	 told me that it was ""disgusting"" for					
Koch to be serving on the National Cancer Advisory Board: ""It's just not good							
for public health. Vested interests should not be on the board."" He went on							
Those boards are very important. They're very influential as to Whether N.C.I.							
goes into formaldehyde or not. Billions of dollars are involved in							
formaldehyde.""							
Harold Varmus	 the director of the National Cancer Institute	 knows David Koch					
from Memorial Sloan-Kettering	 which he used to run. He said that	 at					
Sloan-Kettering	 ""a lot of people who gave to us had large business interests.						
The one thing we wouldn't tolerate in our board members is tobacco."" When told							
of Koch Industries' stance on formaldehyde	 Varmus said that he was ""surprised.""						
he David H. Koch Hall of Human Origins	 at the Smithsonian's National Museum of						
Natural History	 is a multimedia exploration of the theory that mankind evolved						
in response to climate change. At the main entrance	 viewers are confronted with						
a giant graph charting the Earth's temperature over the past ten million years							
which notes that it is far cooler now than it.was ten thousand years ago.							
Overhead	 the text reads	 ""HUMANS EVOLVED IN RESPONSE TO A CHANGING WORLD."" The

message	 as amplified by the exhibit's Web site	 is that ""key human adaptations					
evolved in response to environmental instability."" Only at the end of the							
exhibit	 under the headline ""OUR SURVIVAL CHALLENGE	 is it noted that levels of					
carbon dioxide are higher now than they have ever been	 and that they are						
projected to increase dramatically in the next century. No cause is given for							
this development; no mention is made of any possible role played by fossil							
fuels. The exhibit makes it seem part of a natural continuum. The accompanying							
text says	 ""During the period in which humans evolved	 Earth's temperature and					
the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere fluctuated together."" An							
interactive game in the exhibit suggests that humans will continue to adapt to							
climate change in the future. People may build ""underground citieS	 developing						
short	 compact bodies"" or ""curved spines	 so that ""moving around in tight					
spaces will be no problem.""							
Such ideas uncannily echo the Koch message. The company's January newsletter to							
employees	 for instance	 argues that ""fluctuations in the earth's climate					
predate humanity	 and concludes	 ""Since we can't control Mother Nature	 let's				
figure out how to get along with her changes."" Joseph Romm	 a physicist who runs						
the Web site ClimateProgressorg	 is infuriated by the Smithsonian's						
presentation. ""The whole exhibit whitewashes the modern climate issue	 he said.						
I think the Kochs wanted to be seen as some sort of high-minded company							
associated with the greatest natural-history and science museum in the country.							
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015							

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015							
But the truth is	 the exhibit is underwritten by big-time polluters	 who are					
underground funders of action to stop efforts to deal with this threat to							
humanity. I think the Smithsonian should have drawn the line.""							
Cristian Samper	 the museum's director	 said that.the exhibit is not about					
climate change	 and described Koch as ""one of the best donors we've had	 in my					
tenure here	 because he's very interested in the content	 but completely hands					
off."" He noted	 ""I don't know all the details of his involvement in other						
issues.""							
The Kochs have long depended on the public's not knowing all the details about							
them. They have been content to operate what David Koch has called ""the largest							
company that you've never heard of."" But with the growing prominence of the Tea							
Party	 and with increased awareness of the Kochs' ties to the movement	 the					
brothers may find it harder to deflect scrutiny. Recently	 President Obama took						
aim at the Kochs' political network. Speaking at a Democratic National Committee							
fund-raiser	 in Austin	 he warned supporters that the Supreme Court's recent					
ruling in the Citizens United case--which struck down laws prohibiting direct							
corporate spending on campaigns—had made it even easier for big companies to							
hide behind ""groups with harmless-sounding names like Americans for Prosperity.""							
. 0bama said	 ""They don't have to say who	 exactly	 Americans for Prosperity are.				
You don't know if it's a foreign-controlled corporation""—or even	 he added	 ""a

Measuring the impact of public diplomacy programming is expensive and	 if not done using						
longitudinal methods	 imprecise. AF/PDPA is committed to working with R to improve

reporting and measurement of public diplomacy results and to setting expectations for this office							
and the field to move beyond counting activities to counting impact.							
Carrying out the core function of oversight of	 and support for	 the field means more than					
emails and phone calls to posts from Washington (although the value of the weekly phone call							
between PD desk and PAO should not be underestimated). Africa does not have many senior							
PAO positions. Thirty-one out of 44 AF PAO positions are graded for mid- or entry-level							
officers (FS-02 and below). Many PAOs are the sole public diplomacy officer at post and on							
their first PAO tour. As AF/PDPA desk officers have not always had field PD experience	 this						
plan contains actions to build expertise in Washington and the field including adding more							
regional and Washington training opportunities	 coaching/mentoring less-experienced PAOs by						
more experienced officers	 manuals and written guides	 as well as academic and scientific					
fellows who bring specialized expertise into AF/PDPA. These will help the field be more							
effective	 but will not solve the need for additional LES and FSO positions in public affairs						
sections across the continent.							
While AF/PDPA can and must recruit and build public diplomacy officers for service in							
Africa	 there are few	 very limited actions the office can take on its own that will make an					
appreciable difference in retaining good public diplomacy officers at posts. This is not just a							
problem for public diplomacy in Africa. The Department's assignments priority on Iraq							
Afghanistan and Pakistan	 including the promise of ""linked assignments"" and the financial						
incentives that come with service in these countries has had the unintended effect of creating a							
disincentive to serving in Africa. As many posts in Africa are two year tours	 the already						
systematic every-other-year assignment gaps are multiplied by curtailments of officers to serve							
in those countries the Department considers a higher priority.							
Several of the specific actions in this plan are designed to raise the visibility of AF public							
diplomacy and public affairs work in order to garner a regular seat at the policy table	 better						
represent PAOs in Washington	 attract more FSO bidders	 and increase interagency and public-					
private networking. Coalition building and public-private partnerships are a critical part of							
stretching public diplomacy and public affairs resources.							
Separating AF/PDPA by embedding and taking on more work — new audiences							
partners	 and drafting and reporting responsibilities — will mean working more time	 working					
more efficiently	 or letting go of some duties. Some actions in this plan (such as restructuring						
one of AF/PDPAs most highly visible products - the morning clips) will evaluate whether the							
time it takes to perform a task can be reduced.

IV. STRATEGIC PLAN FOR AFRICA BUREAU PUBLIC DIPLOMACY AND							
PUBLIC AFFAIRS							
Philosophy of AF Public Diplomacy (PD) and Public Affairs (PA)							
• PD and PA advance foreign policy objectives; they are essential tools for national							
security and require credibility and legitimacy.							
• PD and PA communicate U.S. government Africa policies to domestic and foreign							
audiences and inform policy-making including	 but not limited to	 providing					
opportunities for policy-makers to listen to these audiences.							
• PD creates an enabling environment for U.S. government policies and U.S. national							
interests in Africa through programming that strikes the right balance of short- and long-							
term engagement activities.							
• PAOs and the public affairs sections of U.S. Missions abroad have the lead on public							
affairs programming and media work in country including	 under chief of mission						
authority	 coordination of interagency public outreach and messaging in country.						
• PD works best when the field is trained	 trusted and empowered to act and when tools						
and messages are adaptable to local realities and the perspectives of the target audience.							
• AF/PDPA personnel are expected to be an essential part of the web of America's diverse							
networks of public	 private and civic actors on Africa	 representing the Department					
modeling integrity	 and learning continuously.						
• AF/PDPA works as a team of high-caliber experts	 each with a specialty supporting and						
backstopping each other	 as well as coaching and cultivating entry-level officers and less-						
experienced colleagues in the field and in Washington.							
• AF/PDPA fosters open communication and encourages creativity and innovation.							
• Effective PD and PA require personnel who reflect	 respect	 understand	 and positively				
engage the diverse composition of our nation and of Africa. AF/PDPA is committed to a							
diverse workforce.							
Mission Statement - AF/PDPA							
The mission of AF public diplomacy and public affairs is to support the achievement of							
U.S. foreign policy goals and objectives	 advance national interests	 and enhance national					
security by understanding	 engaging	 informing and influencing the people of Africa and

informing the people of the United States of America in order to create an enabling environment							
for a healthy	 mutually-beneficial U.S.-African partnership.						
This engagement takes place via daily communications with the media and others							
targeted outreach initiatives to audiences in Africa and in the U.S. related to specific themes	 and						
longer-term people-to-people relationship building efforts between Africa and the United States.							
Role of AF/PDPA							
State Department's expertise on public diplomacy programs and activities in Africa	 on						
the regional African public and media context	 and on the Department's engagement with the						
media and American audiences on African issues resides in AF/PDPA.							
AF/PDPA also houses the Africa Bureau's experts on Africa's cultural	 educational	 and					
media environments	 on electronic social networking/social media in Africa	 and on crafting					
thematic communications strategies for regional Africa policy.

AF/PDPA GOALS							
2010-2014							
I. AF/PDPA is valued for public diplomacy leadership in Africa and for public affairs							
leadership on Africa policy in the U.S.							
Public Diplomacy Leadership							
A primary function of the public diplomacy office in a regional bureau must be to guide							
and oversee public diplomacy operations and programming at U.S. Missions. Management of							
public diplomacy resources	 support	 and training for the field are major parts of AF/PDPA's					
responsibilities. This work is	 and will remain	 largely invisible to the AF policy process. The					
bureau relies on AF/PDPA to align public diplomacy resources with policy priorities and							
national interest and implement public diplomacy programs that produce tangible results.

intensive and results may not be apparent for years. These engagement activities need to be							
shaped by AF/PDPA.							
In order to oversee and support the field more effectively	 AF/PDPA will take steps to						
improve interaction between the PD desks	 PAOs and AF's geographic offices	 and to engage					
more in interagency and intradepartmental networking and coalition building in Washington. AF							
posts will increase reporting of their results and impact	 not just activities (outcomes not just						
outputs). AF/PDPA staff will build their own knowledge of	 and expertise in	 public diplomacy					
activities	 staff and environments in Africa.						
By 2014	 AF/PD will be D.C.'s experts on the full range of PD activities on the ground at						
AF posts	 networked in the U.S. and linked to the field sufficiently to promote and garner						
resources and opportunities for posts.							
Public Affairs Leadership							
The State Department's expertise on engagement with the U.S. domestic and major							
global media and with targeted domestic audiences on Africa policy resides in AF/PDPA. AF/PA							
is responsible for serving as AF's spokespeople and providing the Department and posts with							
press guidance and media relations expertise. AF/PA cultivates the U.S.-based media (traditional							
and social/new) and informs AF and posts about Africa coverage in the U.S. and major global							
media. AF/PA leads coordination of AF's domestic public speaking (non-Congressional) and AF							
Speakers Bureau. AF/PA has the lead in AF on U.S.-based diaspora engagement and on							
interagency communications strategy and messaging related to Africa policy.							
By 2014	 AF/PA will be valued equally for its communications strategy	 public outreach					
and media expertise and will be recognized as AF bureau spokespeople	 as appropriate.						
II. Policy-making on Africa is informed by an understanding							
of public perspectives. State depends on AF/PDPA for							
expertise and advice on understanding	 informing						
engaging	 and persuading publics in Africa and informing						
the U.S. public.							
The ear of the leader							
must ring with the							
voices of the people.""							
#NAME?							
Policy on any topic that affects Africa should be informed by an understanding of how							
the global media as well as public audiences in Africa may receive and then re-broadcast their							
own interpretation of U.S. government actions	 and of U.S. government programs						
communications strategies	 tools and outreach strategies to inform	 inspire and persuade those					
publics. Africa policy also should be informed by an understanding of the interests of the							
American public.

III. The conduct of public diplomacy in Africa and AF's public affairs in the U.S. is							
strengthened and enhanced via the achievement of specific	 measurable public						
diplomacy and public affairs program objectives.							
Public diplomacy and public affairs support U.S. foreign policy goals	 advance national						
interests	 and enhance national security through the measurable achievement of program						
objectives aligned with policy priorities and targeted strategically at priority audiences. An							
enabling environment for a healthy	 mutually-beneficial U.S.-African partnership is created						
through greater U.S. government engagement of the diaspora	 women	 youth	 faith communities				
and public opinion leaders in academia	 business	 media	 civil society and the arts.				
By 2014	 AF/PDPA will support Africa policy across a range of priorities and also will						
have achieved measurable results in specific areas of expertise.

AF/PDPA positions should be of such value	 substance						
and visibility that they attract and retain FSOs and civil servants							
eager to be part of the Africa policymaking hub with a focus on							
understanding and influencing public opinion and sowing the							
You are not here merely to							
make a living. You are here in

to enrich the world	 and you						
impoverish yourself if you forget

Annex II							
Approach & Methodology:							
The contractor is using a classic collaborative strategic planning process for							
strengthening and sustaining organizational development and achievement grounded in the work							
of John M. Bryson and his book Strategic Planning for Public and Nonprofit Organizations	 3rd						
edition (John Wiley & Sons	 Inc. 2004). Purpose trumps everything and the purpose must						
ultimately be to create public value.							
This structured process included four phases:							
A) The first phase was an assessment of the AF/PDPA office (weeks 1-8).							
B) Phase two was the articulation of a common vision for what AF/PDPA's strategic role							
function and results should be within the Bureau of African Affairs (Weeks 9-11).							
C) The development and refinement of strategies to get from point A to point B as well as							
identifying performance measurements was phase three (Weeks 11-16) followed by the							
contractor writing up the plan (weeks 17-18). Phase four is then the actual							
implementation of these strategies (Week 16+).							
A quietly	 deliberately	 disruptive process	 inserting the contractor into the daily rhythms of				
the office including participation in routine meetings is designed to elicit strategic thinking							
during AF/PDPA's daily work. AF/PDPA staff has not hesitated to implement best practices as							
they arise.							
The most important techniques utilized were individual thinking and group discussion.							
As the guide in this process	 during the first phase the contractor is conducting on and off-site						
interviews of stakeholders within the Department of State in Washington D.C.	 in Kampala						
Uganda during an FSI strategic planning course for Africa	 and by phone to PAOs across Africa.						
In addition to compiling the results of the interviews	 as appropriate	 the contractor also					
gathered information about trends	 challenges and opportunities in Africa	 reviewing pertinent					
internal and external documents; meeting weekly with the AF/PDPA Office Director and Deputy							
Director to review progress	 share findings and consult on next steps; meeting weekly with a core						
group of AF/PDPA personnel who volunteered to form an internal	 collaborative Organizational						
Development Team to review information gathered by the consultant and hash out ideas and							
concepts	 and reviewing the substance of this Phase 1 report and its findings with the AF/PDPA						
office and individuals affected by this report.							
The contractor assembled all materials from the questionnaires to the worksheets for							
analysis. The contractor has conducted and compiled all interviews. Fifty-three people were							
interviewed individually or in pairs.							
During this first phase	 ""why"" has been the most important question. For example: Why do						
you do X? Why does it matter? Why A and not B? Followed by ""for whom?"" (primary							
audience) and ""what is the value added of that action/effort/paper?""

AF/PDPA STAFFING							
AF/PDPA's domestic public affairs side has four dedicated positions to handle media							
press guidance	 statements	 and outreach to the American public and the African diaspora in the					
United States. The public diplomacy side has seven positions in Washington and two for							
Americans at African Regional Services (ARS) in Paris. (ARS Paris provides programming							
tools and support to all African posts with an emphasis on Francophone countries and engages							
the sizeable Paris-based African media and diaspora communities.) Six people have portfolios							
that include both sides of the office: the office director	 deputy director	 administrative officer					
program and project specialist	 and OMS.						
There are 48 posts in Africa	 39 of which have Public Affairs Sections headed by an						
American Public Affairs Officer (PAO). By mid-2011 this will be up to 46. About half the							
public affairs sections are single-officer sections	 often an officer's first PD tour.						
Other State bureaus have regional support specialists in public affairs sections in Africa							
including information resource officers	 regional English language officers	 and regional					
Information Resource Officers. In Kampala	 an exemplary case	 the PAO has opened the door to					
communications specialists from PEPFAR and other USG to sit in the Public Affairs Section. At							
other posts DoD MIST teams sit in the Mission's public affairs section.

public. And not just conservative: William S. White	 in his 1956 book ""Citadel	 called the						
Senate ""to a most peculiar degree	 a Southern Institution ... growing at the heart of this ostensibly national assembly""							
and ""the only place in the country where the South did not lose the war.""								
By mid-century	 it had become a journalistic cliché to call the Senate broken. Otto Preminger's 1962 film ""Advise and							
Consent	 based on the novel by Allen Drury	 is about the Senate of that period	 and it presents Democrats and					
Republicans as equally amoral	 calculating	 and power-hungry. But the institution	 as depicted by Preminger	 still works				
in its way: though the deals stink	 they get cut. The senators know their colleagues and the rules; they back-stab one							
another in the lunchroom	 then drink cocktails and play cards on Saturday nights. There are no lobbyists	 no fund-						
raisers	 no media	 no constituents—only senators' intricate relations with one another. The Senate is its own world.						
In a memoir	 Johnson's longtime aide Harry McPherson recalls learning that the Senate's ""famous 'club' atmosphere is							
based on the members' mutual acceptance of responsibility and concentration on the tasks at hand.... They thrust								
hard at one another in debate over serious matters	 but	 he writes	 ""understanding and accommodation in the ordinary					
course of the Senate day was essential to sanity."" Johnson	 the most powerful Majority Leader in history	 bent the						
Senate to his will and forced it to become more efficient. He saw his colleagues as either ""whales""—the heavyweight								
chairmen who negotiated legislation—or ""minnows	 the followers who went along with the brokered deals. And when							
in 1958	 a formidable new class of liberal Democrats entered the Senate—including Edmund Muskie	 Eugene McCarthy						
and Philip Hart—the legislative machinery began to produce reform. Michael Janeway	 the author of ""The Fall of the							
House of Roosevelt	 worked as a summer staff member between 1958 and 1962. ""They used to talk to each other—							
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015								

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015								
that's my most vivid recollection	 he said. ""If Wayne Morse talked of constitutional law on the floor	 the Southerners						
would come in to hear him. The same with Hubert Humphrey on farm policy. My strongest impression was of it being a								
deliberative body	 drawing each other out—sometimes pedantically."" Senators who ran for office in order to work on							
foreign policy	 social welfare	 or urbanization had to win credibility with the whales. ""But if you wanted to do something						
there was a mechanism by which you could do it	 Janeway said.							
In the sixties and seventies	 Southern-conservative control was broken by a coalition of left-of-center Democrats and							
moderate Republicans. Donald Ritchie	 the Senate historian	 who started working there in 1976	 described the Senate of					
those decades as ""a bipartisan liberal institution."" The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was written largely out of the office of the								
Republican Minority Leader	 Everett Dirksen. Every major initiative—voting rights	 open housing	 environmental law					
campaign reform—enjoyed bipartisan support. In the rare event of a filibuster	 the motion to end debate was often filed							
jointly by leaders of both parties. When Medicare—that government takeover of health care for the elderly—was								
passed	 in 1965	 it won 70-24.						
The Senate's momentum nurtured superb talent: William Fulbright	 Everett Dirksen	 Henry Jackson	 Frank Church					
Howard Baker. In 1969	 George McGovern chaired a select committee on hunger that actually held bipartisan ""field							
hearings"" in poor regions	 calling witnesses in migrant labor camps	 and then	 with Bob Dole's indispensable support					
greatly expanded the food-stamp program. The intensity of senatorial purpose in those years must strike today's								
legislators as profoundly humbling. After Joe Biden came to the Senate	 in 1973	 Hubert Humphrey took him aside and						
said	 ""You have to pick an issue that becomes yours. That's how you attract your colleagues to follow you	 Joe. That's						
how you demonstrate your bona fides. Don't be a gadfly."" Humphrey's career advice: ""You should become Mr. Housing.								
Housing is the future.""								
The Senate's modern decline began in 1978	 with the election of a new wave of anti-government conservatives	 and						
accelerated as Republicans became the majority in 1981. ""The Quayle generation came in	 and there were a number of							
people just like Dan—same generation	 same hair style	 same beliefs	 Gary Hart	 the Colorado Democrat	 recalled.			
They were harder-line. They weren't there to get along with Democrats. But they look accommodationist compared to								
Republicans in the Senate today."" Church	 McGovern	 Javits	 and Birch Bayh were gone. Ira Shapiro	 the former aide				
who is writing a book about the Senate of the sixties and seventies	 said	 ""It was a huge loss of the most experienced						
accomplished senators being replaced by neophytes. All of a sudden	 in 1981	 more than half the Senate had been there						
less than six years."" He added	 ""The shattering of the great Senate has long-term effects that keep showing up. It gets							
worse over time	 but it just never gets restored. There was a phrase I heard from Helms and the younger ones: 'Others							
didn't want to make waves; I wanted to drain the swamp.'""								
After C-SPAN went on the air	 in 1979	 the cozy atmosphere that encouraged both deliberation and back-room deals						
began to yield to transparency and	 with it	 posturing. ""So Damn Much Money	 a recent book by the Washington Post					
reporter Robert G. Kaiser	 traces the spectacular rise of Washington lobbying to the same period. Liberal Republicans							
began to disappear	 and as Southern Democrats died out they were replaced by conservative Republicans. Bipartisan							
coalitions on both wings of the Senate vanished. The institutionalist gave way to the free agent	 who controlled his own							
fund-raising apparatus and media presence	 and whose electoral base was a patchwork of single-issue groups. Members							
of both parties—Howard Metzenbaum	 the Ohio Democrat; Jesse Helms	 the North Carolina Republican—took to						
regularly using the Senate's rules to tie up business for narrowly ideological reasons. The number of filibusters shot up in								
the eighties and continued to rise in the following decades	 as the parties kept alternating control of the Senate and							
escalating a procedural arms race	 routinely blocking the confirmation of executive and judicial appointees. Democrats							
filibustered Republican nominees to the bench; then Republicans threatened to ban the filibuster in such cases—the so-								
called ""nuclear option."" Older members were perturbed when	 in 2004	 the Republican Majority Leader	 Bill Frist	 went				
to South Dakota to campaign against the Democratic Minority Leader	 Tom Daschle (who went on to lose). A few years							
earlier	 such an action would have been unthinkable.							
The weakened institution could no longer withstand pressures from outside its walls; as money and cameras rushed in								
independent minds fell more and more in line with the partisans. Rough parity between the two parties meant that								
every election had the potential to make or break a majority	 crushing the incentive to cooperate across the aisle. The							
Senate	 no longer a fount of ideas	 became a backwater of the U.S. government. During the Clinton years	 the main					
action was between the White House and the Gingrich House of Representatives; during the Bush years	 the Republican							
Senate majority abdicated the oversight role that could have placed a vital check on executive power.								
Norman Ornstein	 a congressional expert at the American Enterprise Institute	 said that the Senate has increasingly						
become populated by ""ideologues and charlatans."" He went on	 ""When we do get good people who come in	 they very						
quickly get ground up by the dynamic and the culture of the parties. And once you get there	 look at what it takes to stay

there."" He spoke of Charles Grassley	 the Iowa Republican	 who	 nearing the end of his career	 spent much of last year				
working closely with his friend Max Baucus on the health-care bill. Then	 in August	 Grassley went home and	 faced with					
angry Republican voters and the prospect of a primary challenge from the right	 started warning about ""pulling the plug							
on Grandma."" Ornstein added that similar pressures had led John McCain to begin ""altering his behavior and								
abandoning every issue	 including campaign-finance reform.""							
One morning in April	 I visited Harry McPherson	 the former L.B.J. aide	 at the offices of the legal and lobbying firm D. L.					
A. Piper	 in downtown Washington. McPherson	 who is eighty	 had on his desk the firm's spiral-bound directory for the					
111th Congress. I asked him who	 in Johnsonian terms	 were the whales of the current Senate. McPherson ran his finger						
down the list of senators. He did it again. ""I'm trying here	 looking for a remote descendant. Judas Priest	 look at this.""						
He was stumped. ""Well	 I see some good people	 I see some people who are going to get coalitions together over time.""						
He put the directory aside. ""I'm just having the damnedest time.""								
Down the hall from McPherson's office was that of Mel Martinez	 a former Republican senator from Florida; he was							
hired last year	 two weeks after resigning his Senate seat without completing his first term. (He has since moved on to							
JPMorgan Chase.) William Cohen	 the former Maine senator and Secretary of Defense	 has an office downstairs. Tom						
Daschle works at D. L. A. Piper; his predecessor as Democratic leader	 George Mitchell	 was the firm's chairman	 until					
President Obama appointed him to be his Middle East envoy. One feature of the diminished U.S. senator is the ease with								
which he moves from legislating to lobbying. Between 1998 and 2004	 half the senators who left office became							
lobbyists. In 2007	 Trent Lott	 a Republican leader in the Senate less than a year into his fourth term	 abruptly resigned					
and formed a lobbying firm with former Senator John Breaux	 just a few weeks before a new law took effect requiring a							
two-year waiting period between serving and lobbying.								
When you spend your days at the Senate	 it's easy to forget about everything else. The House of Representatives seems							
miles away (it's just down a corridor and across the rotunda)	 the White House is another country	 and actual foreign						
countries are unimaginable. The place remains insular	 labyrinthine	 and opaque—even physically. Senators commute						
thirty seconds between their offices and the chamber by electric subway cars that run along a tunnel under Constitution								
Avenue. Many signs are misleading or obsolete (the gilded lettering over the visitors' gallery says ""Men's Gallery"")	 and							
the Capitol is filled with secret passageways and spare rooms	 called hideaways	 doled out according to seniority	 where					
senators can read	 drink	 doze	 and wait for the buzzer announcing an imminent vote. The most pervasive authority over					
the institution is not the Constitution or the Bible but	 rather	 an impenetrable sixteen-hundred-page tome	 by Floyd M.					
Riddick	 called ""Senate Procedure: Precedents and Practices	 which only the late Robert Byrd	 of West Virginia	 was				
known to have read in its entirety. The procedures are so abstruse that a parliamentarian must sit below the presiding								
officer and	 essentially	 tell him or her what to say.						
After half a century	 the picture given by Preminger's ""Advise and Consent"" is still faintly visible. ""The Senate	 by its						
nature	 is a place where consensus reigns and personal relationships are paramount	 Lamar Alexander said. ""And that's						
not changed."" Which is exactly the problem: it's a self-governing body that depends on the reasonableness of its								
members to function. Sarah Binder	 a congressional scholar at George Washington University	 said	 ""To have a chamber					
that rules by unanimous consent—it's nutty! Especially when you've got Jim Bunning to please.""								
In 2006 and 2008	 sixteen Democrats entered the Senate	 giving the Party its current majority of fifty-nine to forty-one						
(counting two independents). They include moderates	 like Jon Tester	 of Montana	 and Mark Warner	 of Virginia;				
liberals	 like Sherrod Brown	 of Ohio	 and Sheldon Whitehouse	 of Rhode Island; policy specialists	 like Amy Klobuchar	 of		
Minnesota	 and Jeff Merkley; and iconoclasts	 like Claire McCaskill. Their interest in legislating has won the admiration of						
senior senators. ""If they can stay	 I think they'll be terrific	 Chris Dodd said. ""My worry is they won't stay. Because it's						
not productive.""								
The Democratic class of 2008 arrived with President Obama	 expecting to usher in a dynamic new era. Instead	 their						
young Senate careers have passed in a daily slog of threatened filibusters and ""secret holds""—when a senator								
anonymously objects to bringing an appointment up for a vote	 which requires unanimous consent. On April 20th	 Claire						
McCaskill took the trouble to read off the names of fifty-six Obama nominees languishing in the limbo of secret holds								
and Jon Kyl objected to every one of them. Just getting a bill to the floor for debate can require days of tactical								
gamesmanship between the party leaders. There were times when Warner wondered if anyone had ever quit in the first								
year. Michael Bennet said	 ""We find ourselves at a moment in our history when the questions are huge ones	 not small						
ones	 and where things have been put off for a really long period of time."" He mentioned the national debt	 energy						
policy	 and the financial crisis. ""Yet you have a Senate that's designed not to advance change but to slow it.""							
We were talking in his hideaway	 a windowless room in the Capitol basement	 which had a mini-fridge stocked with						
bottled water	 black leatherette furniture circa 1962	 and a TV tuned to C-SPAN2 on mute; Senator Kyl's mouth was

moving. Bennet	 the former superintendent of schools in Denver	 was appointed to a vacant seat in 2009	 and already					
has to defend it this year. He described the Senate with the dry bluntness of an outsider who hasn't allowed himself to								
grow too attached. Bennet repeated a story he had heard about a new congressman giving his maiden speech: ""And								
then some more veteran guy came over and said	 'Son	 you're talking like this place is on the level. It's not on the level.'						
As the fifteen months or so have gone by that I've been here	 the less on the level it seems.""							
Earlier this year	 the Senate's procedural absurdities became national news twice in one month. On February 4th							
CongressDaily reported that Richard Shelby	 an Alabama Republican	 was secretly blocking the confirmation of seventy						
Obama appointees over a dispute involving defense earmarks for his state. (His tactics exposed	 Shelby—whose office							
maintains that he was responsible for fewer than fifty holds—lifted all but three.) Later that month	 Bunning spent							
several days and a late night on the Senate floor	 filibustering to prevent benefits from being paid to millions of							
unemployed Americans. When Merkley tried to reason with him	 Bunning responded	 ""Tough shit."" (Eventually						
Republicans persuaded Bunning to stop.)								
These incidents elicited a brief outcry	 but the extent of the Senate's routine folly remains largely hidden. For example							
Grassley and Ron Wyden	 of Oregon	 have been trying since 1997 to end the practice of secret holds	 without success. In					
2007	 the Senate passed a bill banning secret holds that last longer than six days. But to get around the ban two or more							
senators can pass the hold back and forth—it's called ""rolling holds""—and their party leader facilitates the game by								
keeping their names secret.								
Many of the Senate's antique rules and precedents have been warped beyond recognition by the modern pressures of								
partisanship. The hold	 for example	 was a courtesy extended to senators in the days of horse travel	 when they needed					
time to get back to Washington and read a bill or question an appointee before casting their vote. Sarah Binder	 who co-							
authored a book on the filibuster	 calls the procedure a historical accident: in 1806	 the Senate got rid of a little-used						
rule that allowed the ""previous question"" to be called to a vote. Suddenly	 there was no inherent limit on debate	 and by						
the eighteen-thirties senators had begun taking advantage of this loophole	 derailing the proceedings by getting up and							
talking until their voice	 legs	 or bladder gave out. (The word ""filibuster"" comes from vrijbuiter—old Dutch for ""looter."")						
In 1917	 Woodrow Wilson	 with his wartime legislative agenda blocked by filibusters	 forced the Senate to pass Rule XXII					
which allowed a two-thirds majority to bring a floor debate to an end with a ""cloture"" vote. For decades	 the rule was							
rarely used; between 1919 and 1971	 there were only forty-nine cloture votes	 fewer than one per year. In the seventies						
and eighties	 the annual average rose to about a dozen. (Frustration with this increase led the Senate	 in 1975	 to lower					
the threshold for cloture to sixty votes.) In the nineties and early aughts	 the average went up to twenty-five or thirty a							
year	 as both parties escalated their use of the filibuster when they found themselves in the minority. After the							
Republicans lost their majority in 2006	 filibusters became everyday events: there were a hundred and twelve cloture							
votes in 2007 and 2008	 and this session Republicans are on target to break their own filibuster record.							
The tally of cloture votes reflects only a small fraction of senatorial obstruction. Three hundred and forty-five bills								
passed by the House have been prevented from even coming up for debate in the Senate. ""Why?"" Steny Hoyer	 the							
outraged Democratic Majority Leader of the House	 asked me. ""Because they do not do their business in a way that							
facilitates noncontroversial things. Thankfully	 the House of Representatives is not becoming the Senate."" Last week	 six						
House Democrats expressed their displeasure with the upper chamber by staging a sit-in of sorts on the Senate floor.								
Seventy-six nominees for judgeships and executive posts have been approved by committees but	 because of blocks							
haven't come up for a vote in the full Senate	 leaving courtrooms idle and jobs unfilled across the upper levels of the							
Obama Administration. (The Democrats also practiced the art of blocking nominees during the Bush Administration.)								
There's often no objection to the individual being blocked: after an eight-month hold	 Martha Johnson	 nominated to						
run the General Services Administration	 was confirmed 96-0. On an issue like health-care reform	 when the objection						
was substantive	 Republicans ransacked Riddick's ""Senate Procedure"" for every conceivable way to delay a debate and							
vote. Judd Gregg even sent a memo on stalling tactics to his Republican colleagues. Tom Coburn demanded the reading								
aloud of an entire seven-hundred-and-sixty-seven-page amendment proposed by Bernie Sanders	 the Vermont socialist;							
Senate clerks	 working in half-hour shifts	 were three hours into the chore when Sanders withdrew the amendment in						
frustration.								
Under McConnell	 Republicans have consistently consumed as much of the Senate's calendar as possible with legislative							
maneuvering. The strategy is not to extend deliberation of the Senate's agenda but to prevent it. Tom Harkin	 who first							
proposed reform of the filibuster in 1995	 called his Republican colleagues ""nihilists	 who want to create chaos because						
it serves their ideology. ""If there's chaos	 things will tend toward simple solutions	 Harkin said. ""In chaos people don't						
listen to reason."" McConnell did not respond to requests for an interview	 but he has often argued that the Republican							
strategy reflects the views of a majority of Americans. In March	 he told the Times	 ""To the extent that they""—the						
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015								

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015								
Democrats—""want to do things that we think are in the political center and would be helpful to the country	 we'll be							
helpful. To the extent they are trying to turn us into a Western European country	 we are not going to be helpful.""							
One of the mysteries of the Senate is how Mitch McConnell has been able to keep his members in line	 on vote after							
vote. Why do moderates with years of experience and their own power base back home—Richard Lugar	 of Indiana;							
Susan Collins	 of Maine; George Voinovich	 of Ohio—keep siding with the more extreme members of their caucus?						
Alexander said that McConnell listens well to all his members	 adding	 ""When you have your back against the wall and						
the gallows are hanging in front of you	 it tends to unify. Operating with forty members—it concentrates the mind.""							
Lindsey Graham described to the Times how McConnell exhorted his caucus after the disastrous 2008 election: ""He said								
if we didn't stick together on big things	 we wouldn't be relevant."" Last December	 the Republicans decided to filibuster						
a military-spending bill in order to delay the looming vote on health care until as close to Christmas as possible. Thad								
Cochran	 the Republican ranking member of the Appropriations Committee	 promised Daniel Inouye	 the chairman	 that				
he wouldn't join the effort. But at the last minute Cochran	 who has been in the Senate since 1979 and brings							
disproportionate amounts of defense money to Mississippi	 told Reid that his leadership wouldn't allow him to vote with							
the Democrats and end the filibuster—even on a matter of national security. (The Democrats were able to impose								
cloture	 and the vote on health care finally took place on Christmas Eve.)							
Republican defections have been rare. In early 2009	 Collins and Olympia Snowe	 also of Maine	 voted for the stimulus					
bill	 along with Arlen Specter (who promptly switched parties). Snowe also voted for the Finance Committee's health-							
care-reform bill last October	 the only Republican to do so. But in December	 at the pivotal moment	 she voted against					
the version that went before the full Senate. ""I wasn't interested in expanding this program beyond the Finance								
Committee version—it grew by a thousand pages	 Snowe said. She wasn't included in the negotiations with White							
House officials that took place in an elegant conference room across from Reid's suite of offices	 and said that the							
Democrats ""did not accept any of my proposals. As I said to the President	 it was all windup and no pitch."" McConnell							
was able to exploit her alienation. A friend of Snowe cited another reason for her reversal: ""She actually said to me once								
that she had never felt the pressure that she felt on health care	 never before had that pressure been quite as evident to							
her or quite as real or troubling. Kyl and McConnell were saying things like 'You just can't let us down	 we're all in this							
together. You're a senior Republican member of this caucus	 and you just have to hang tough with us. We expect it and							
you're going to do it.'""								
Reid doesn't use such tough tactics; he has achieved his position	 in spite of his public shortcomings	 by being the						
senator who helped other Democrats	 always answered their calls	 and got them what they wanted through masterly						
maneuvering. This has made him enormously popular within the Democratic caucus	 but it doesn't give him the leverage							
of McConnell	 let alone of Lyndon Johnson.							
In the current Senate	 it has become normal for a handful of senators	 sometimes representing just ten or twenty per						
cent of the country's population	 to hold everything up. And the status quo has become sufficiently frustrating that a							
few new senators have considered a radical option: mutiny.								
Tom Udall	 who is sixty-two	 is older than most freshman senators. He has the crow's-feet of a Westerner who has spent						
time in the sun	 and a slow	 good-natured voice. His father	 Stewart	 was an Arizona congressman and the Interior				
Secretary for Presidents Kennedy and Johnson; his uncle Mo was a legendary Arizona representative; his cousin Mark is								
a freshman senator from Colorado. Udall served five terms in the House before winning a Senate seat from New Mexico								
in 2008. And yet he has the air of a political Candide—he is always earnest	 capable of disappointment but not cynicism.							
I ran on the idea that the Senate should not be a graveyard for good ideas	 he said. ""Then to be on the inside—the							
thing that strikes you is how one senator can hold up the whole show.""								
In his first year in office	 Udall decided to do something audacious: he would try to change the Senate's rules.							
Customarily	 the rules continue session after session	 and a provision in Rule XXII requires sixty-seven votes to amend						
them	 making it extremely difficult. (""Rule XXII is a Catch-22	 Ted Kennedy used to joke.) Udall embraced a different						
idea—the ""constitutional option."" Article I	 Section 5 of the Constitution states that ""each House may determine the							
Rules of its Proceedings"" at the beginning of the new Congress. So	 in theory	 a senator could take the floor next January						
and propose debating its rules from scratch	 including the filibuster. New rules could be passed with a simple majority.							
There's even a precedent for this: moves to revisit the rules by invoking the constitutional option have been made three								
times	 most recently in 1975. Udall has spent much of the past year trying to build support for the idea.							
At the request of Udall and others	 Schumer	 who is the chairman of the Rules Committee	 has held a series of hearings					
on the filibuster	 calling witnesses such as Sarah Binder	 the historian	 and Walter Mondale	 who was in the Senate when				
the constitutional option was invoked in 1975. Dick Durbin	 the second-highest-ranking Democrat	 has organized						
working groups among newer members on other internal reforms	 such as ending secret holds and choosing committee

chairs by caucus vote rather than by seniority. (Lamar Alexander wryly suggested to me that Schumer and Durbin were								
competing for the favor of newer members	 in case Harry Reid loses his seat in the fall and they run against each other							
for Majority Leader.)								
For Republican institutionalists	 such as Alexander and Gregg	 the push for rules reform is folly. ""If you want a						
parliamentary form of government	 go over to the House	 Gregg	 who is about to retire	 scoffed. ""Why even run for the				
Senate?"" Udall's plan for next January	 he said	 would be a ""gigantic mistake.""						
They'll get over it	 Alexander said of the Democrats' enthusiasm for rules reform. ""And they'll get over it quicker if							
they're in the minority next January. Because they'll instantly see the value of slowing the Senate down to consider								
whatever they have to say."" He added that the Senate ""may be getting done about as much as the American people								
want done."" The President's ambitious agenda	 after all	 has upset a lot of voters	 across the political spectrum. None of					
the Republicans I spoke to agreed with the contention that the Senate is ""broken."" Alexander claimed that he and other								
Republicans were exercising the moderating	 thoughtful influence on legislation that the founders wanted in the Senate.							
The Senate wasn't created to be efficient	 he argued. ""It was created to be inefficient."" At one of the filibuster							
hearings	 in April	 Alexander	 sitting across the table from Udall	 said that	 for all the times the Democrats charge the			
Republicans with obstructing legislation	 ""we could say that's the number of times the majority has tried to cut off our							
right to debate	 our right to offer amendments	 which is the essence of the Senate.""						
Newcomers like Udall seem to think that the Senate has grown so absurd and extreme that some kind of reform is								
inevitable. Perhaps they need more time to plumb the depths of the institution's intransigence. According to Sarah								
Binder	 a change in rules is extremely unlikely; Republicans would be implacably opposed to	 say	 weakening the					
filibuster	 and so would some Democrats	 especially long-serving ones. ""I would oppose that	 Chris Dodd said	 adding of				
the freshmen	 ""These are people who have never been in the minority."" For older Democrats	 who have put in their						
years	 grown adept at working the rules	 and now chair powerful committees	 the reform impulse could be a threat.					
(Among senior senators	 the sole enthusiast for rules reform is Tom Harkin.) One senator spoke of the Senate as being							
divided not between whales and minnows but	 rather	 between bulls and calves. The older Democrats are too						
accustomed to the Senate's ways to share the frustrations of the newcomers; the handful of older moderate								
Republicans are too weak to challenge the newer radicals who now dominate the caucus.								
Even if the freshmen Democrats can somehow reform the filibuster next January	 the Senate will remain a sclerotic							
wasteful	 unhappy body. The deepest source of its problems is not rules and precedents but	 rather	 its human beings					
who have created a culture where Tocqueville's ""lofty thoughts"" and ""generous impulses"" have no place.								
A few days after passing health-care reform	 the Senate struggled to its feet to take on a second large task. Financial							
regulatory reform should have been the easiest piece of major legislation of the Obama Presidency	 the likeliest to win							
real bipartisan support. The financial crisis had been catastrophic for millions of Americans	 and after the 2008 bailout							
Wall Street had become even more hated than the Senate was. In April	 a lineup of bankers from Goldman Sachs							
appeared before Senator Levin's subcommittee on investigations	 and managed to appear as arrogant	 callous	 and					
evasive as their reputations had suggested. The public demanded action. Some Republicans had a genuine desire to pass								
a bill. If health-care reform had been a war of attrition	 financial reform was a promising liaison.							
The affair began with a Republican	 Bob Corker	 and a Democrat	 Mark Warner—both multimillionaires serving their first					
term	 both considered centrists. Corker is a small	 dapper former construction magnate who became the mayor of						
Chattanooga; Warner is a tall	 preppily dressed former telecommunications entrepreneur who became the governor of							
Virginia. Chris Dodd	 the Banking Committee chairman	 assigned them to work together on the section of the bill having						
to do with the liquidation of troubled firms—making sure that there would never be another taxpayer bailout. They								
worked through the winter	 in Warner's office	 in Corker's office	 over dinner	 sometimes without staff	 as if they were			
members of a Senate from the past. They hosted a series of afternoon seminars	 inviting guests such as Ben Bernanke							
Alan Greenspan	 and Sheila Bair. Corker and Warner were sometimes said to be the only Democrat and Republican still							
talking to each other. In January	 Business Week called them the Senate's ""Odd Couple."" By February	 they had finished						
their work.								
Meanwhile	 discussions about the entire bill between Dodd and Richard Shelby	 the top Republican on the committee						
dragged on	 repeatedly breaking down. Finally	 on February 10th	 Dodd called Corker	 who	 though he was one of the			
committee's junior members	 agreed to be the chairman's Republican negotiating partner. When Corker informed							
McConnell and Shelby	 they expressed surprise. ""It was an odd place to be	 Corker recalled. ""And yet that night we						
began meeting."" The junior Republican savored the rare experience of creating	 rather than opposing	 legislation. In						
response	 Shelby's conservative staff tried to undermine Corker	 spreading rumors among Republicans and their

lobbyists that he was giving too much away. (A Shelby aide said that staff members were simply informing other								
Republicans of the Party's line on financial reform.)								
On March 10th	 Dodd concluded that he had to move a bill to the floor. He called Corker and said	 ""You've been a great						
partner."" He was ending their talks after only a month. ""It's a little stunning	 I've got to be honest	 Corker told reporters						
afterward. Someone close to the negotiations compared Corker to Dickens's Miss Havisham	 unable to get over the							
rebuff	 forever awaiting the arrival of her groom	 all her clocks stopped. Corker later said that Dodd had ended the talks						
under pressure from the White House and other Democrats. Dodd said that Corker had been unable to bring any other								
Republicans with him. ""Baloney	 Corker said. ""If Dodd had reached an agreement with me	 we'd've had at least twenty-						
five Republican votes.""								
The bill that Dodd brought before the Senate	 after a year of discussions with Democrats and Republicans alike							
incorporated the bipartisan plan of Warner and Corker to prevent another bank bailout: setting up a fifty-billion-dollar								
fund	 paid for by the banks	 to insure orderly liquidation	 and establishing a risk council to detect warning signs of					
another crisis. But in mid-April Mitch McConnell—who had just met with Wall Street executives in New York	 and was							
now parroting talking points from a memo written by the Republican strategist Frank Luntz—called it a ""partisan bill""								
that ""will guarantee perpetual taxpayer bailout of Wall Street banks."" McConnell presented a letter	 signed by all forty-							
one Republicans	 suggesting that they would filibuster the financial-reform bill.							
His remarks amounted to a repudiation of Corker's work as well as of Dodd's. The next day	 April 15th	 Corker pleaded						
with his colleagues	 in his Tennessee twang	 ""Let's come to the floor and let's act like adults. Let's tone down the						
rhetoric. Let's don't exaggerate the pluses or minuses. Let's do what the Senate was created to do.... We were								
supposed to be the people that took some of the red-hot activities that sometimes come from the other body and sat								
down with cooler heads and resolved the issues like adults. We can do that. As a matter of fact	 I would say	 if we cannot						
do that on financial regulation	 an issue that really doesn't have any real philosophical bearings to it ..."" Corker didn't							
allow the thought to ripen—he had already gone farther than almost any Republican would have dared.								
Dodd spoke later in the day and completed Corker's speech: ""I know my friends on the other side of the aisle are faced								
with a difficult choice between supporting their party leadership and participating in this complicated	 difficult debate. I							
am not naïve. I know that is a hard place to be. But if we can't act like U.S. senators for the sake of this issue ... then								
why are we even here?"" He went on	 ""We work for an American public that is sick and tired of feeling like no one is							
looking out for their interests	 like the political hacks and lobbyists hold all the cards in these discussions. The minority							
seems intent on proving them right.... I have been here a long time. I know this institution is better than that. I know								
there are friends of mine on the other side of the aisle who care about this bill	 who want to be a part of the debate							
who want to be part of the solution.""								
In the same speech	 Dodd joined the partisan fight	 accusing McConnell of lying about the bill. Turning crimson-faced	 he					
chopped the air with his hand as he shouted	 ""I have to ask myself	 why did I go through this process over the last four						
or five months	 agreeing to much of what they were offering	 and there is not a single political vote to show for it.... I						
have to say to the younger members	 the newer members coming along: be careful!""							
Corker	 having heard that Dodd was speaking	 returned to the chamber and asked to respond. ""You and I went a long						
way	 Corker told Dodd. ""Then we stopped. On March 10th it ended. I understand that	 look	 you were losing Democrats					
on your committee.""								
And I was not gaining Republicans	 Dodd replied.							
You had one	 and that is all you asked for when you started. I never said I could speak for anybody but myself. And I did							
not leave the table."" Corker urged Dodd to keep talking to Republicans—their differences could be sorted out in a few								
days.								
But this was not McConnell's agenda. Instead	 financial reform became a slightly more polite repeat of the health-care-							
reform brawl: the Republicans threatened filibusters	 the Democrats threatened all-nighters	 and thousands of lobbyists						
prowled the Capitol	 charging their Wall Street clients more than a billion dollars. On April 28th	 I was sitting in the						
ornate Reception Room with Jim Manley	 Reid's spokesman. On the other side of the wall	 there was the noise of						
furniture scraping across a tile floor. ""Those are cots being set up in the L.B.J. Room	 Manley said. ""Very little happens							
around here without a deadline."" The cots persuaded Republicans to allow the bill to move to the floor for debate. A								
few weeks later	 on May 20th	 yet another filibuster was defeated by yet another cloture motion	 and financial reform					
finally came to a vote. It passed	 59-39. Only four Republicans had joined the majority. Corker wasn't among them. He							
had even voted for an amendment	 offered by his Republican colleague Jeff Sessions	 of Alabama	 that would have					
scrapped Corker's work of many months with Warner.

The idea of watching Bob Corker vote for the Sessions amendment!"" Dodd said afterward	 sitting in his red-curtained							
office	 under a print of Holbein's portrait of Thomas More. ""It's the Senate	 I guess."" McConnell's strategy of obstruction						
had once again come close to succeeding	 Dodd said	 but he knew that a ""shrinking number"" of Republicans were						
frustrated. The previous day	 Dodd had said to Susan Collins	 ""God	 I would have loved to have you as my ranking					
member on this."" Collins responded	 ""We could have had such a great time on this bill.""							
Warner	 who said that he believed in bipartisanship because ""the American people don't trust either political party							
enough to give them a blank check	 was astonished that so few Republicans voted for financial reform. ""There was zero							
substantive reason why this couldn't have been eighty votes	 he said. I asked him why Bob Corker had voted no on the							
bill. Warner started to talk about the consumer-protection title	 and then said	 ""If you want to vote against something						
you can always find your reasons.""								
But Corker hadn't seemed to want to vote against it. He had spent months trying to act like a U.S. senator	 alienating							
himself from his own party and then the other party	 and on the day of the vote he held the floor for the better part of							
thirty minutes	 as if he were still reluctant to let the effort go. ""I am obviously disappointed	 he said. ""I think I have						
spent as much time as any senator.								
... on policy regarding our financial system. I think any bill—even this bill—has good								
things in it. There is no question. And I appreciate the thrust. But I think there is a lot of overreaching	 and I think not							
enough time was spent on some of the core issues.""								
As the senators cast their votes	 I noticed Robert Kaiser	 the author of ""So Damn Much Money	 in the press gallery. I					
later asked him if	 with the passage of two big reform bills in three months	 we were witnessing a possible renewal of						
the Senate. ""If you can engage public opinion in a way politicians can understand	 public opinion can still blow away							
money and interest groups	 he said. ""But over the past few decades the reflex has grown in the Senate that	 all things						
considered	 it's better to avoid than to take on big issues. This is the kind of thing that drives Michael Bennet nutty: here							
you've arrived in the United States Senate and you can't do fuck-all about the destruction of the planet.""								
After the final vote on financial reform	 the Republicans flew home	 and the Democratic leaders held a press conference						
smiling before the microphones outside the Senate chamber. Reid said	 ""For those who wanted to protect Wall Street	 it						
didn't work."" He then excused himself: he had to join Biden for a telephone fund-raiser with ""some Nevadans.""								
Durbin said	 ""I was stunned that only four Republicans would join us in passing this historic legislation. What does it take							
to bring the Republican Party into the conversation about the future of America?""								
Dodd	 glowing with triumph	 said	 ""I wanted to demonstrate that the Senate of the United States could conduct its					
business much as our founders intended. We did that.""								
On July 21st	 President Obama signed the completed bill. The two lasting achievements of this Senate	 financial						
regulation and health care	 required a year and a half of legislative warfare that nearly destroyed the body. They							
depended on a set of circumstances—a large majority of Democrats	 a charismatic President with an electoral mandate							
and a national crisis—that will not last long or be repeated anytime soon. Two days after financial reform became law								
Harry Reid announced that the Senate would not take up comprehensive energy-reform legislation for the rest of the								
year. And so climate change joined immigration	 job creation	 food safety	 pilot training	 veterans' care	 campaign			
finance	 transportation security	 labor law	 mine safety	 wildfire management	 and scores of executive and judicial			
appointments on the list of matters that the world's greatest deliberative body is incapable of addressing. Already	 you							
can feel the Senate slipping back into stagnant waters.						Housing is the future.""								
The Senate's modern decline began in 1978	 with the election of a new wave of anti-government conservatives	 and						
accelerated as Republicans became the majority in 1981. ""The Quayle generation came in	 and there were a number of							
people just like Dan—same generation	 same hair style	 same beliefs	 Gary Hart	 the Colorado Democrat	 recalled. ""They			
were harder-line. They weren't there to get along with Democrats. But they look accommodationist compared to								
Republicans in the Senate today."" Church	 McGovern	 Javits	 and Birch Bayh were gone. Ira Shapiro	 the former aide				
who is writing a book about the Senate of the sixties and seventies	 said	 ""It was a huge loss of the most experienced						
accomplished senators being replaced by neophytes. All of a sudden	 in 1981	 more than half the Senate had been there						
less than six years."" He added	 ""The shattering of the great Senate has long-term effects that keep showing up. It gets							
worse over time	 but it just never gets restored. There was a phrase I heard from Helms and the younger ones: 'Others							
didn't want to make waves; I wanted to drain the swamp.'""								
After C-SPAN went on the air	 in 1979	 the cozy atmosphere that encouraged both deliberation and back-room deals						
began to yield to transparency and	 with it	 posturing. ""So Damn Much Money	 a recent book by the Washington Post					
reporter Robert G. Kaiser	 traces the spectacular rise of Washington lobbying to the same period. Liberal Republicans							
began to disappear	 and as Southern Democrats died out they were replaced by conservative Republicans. Bipartisan							
coalitions on both wings of the Senate vanished. The institutionalist gave way to the free agent	 who controlled his own							
fund-raising apparatus and media presence	 and whose electoral base was a patchwork of single-issue groups. Members							
of both parties—Howard Metzenbaum	 the Ohio Democrat; Jesse Helms	 the North Carolina Republican—took to						
regularly using the Senate's rules to tie up business for narrowly ideological reasons. The number of filibusters shot up in								
the eighties and continued to rise in the following decades	 as the parties kept alternating control of the Senate and							
escalating a procedural arms race	 routinely blocking the confirmation of executive and judicial appointees. Democrats							
filibustered Republican nominees to the bench; then Republicans threatened to ban the filibuster in such cases—the so-								
called ""nuclear option."" Older members were perturbed when	 in 2004	 the Republican Majority Leader	 Bill Frist	 went to				
South Dakota to campaign against the Democratic Minority Leader	 Tom Daschle (who went on to lose). A few years							
earlier	 such an action would have been unthinkable.							
The weakened institution could no longer withstand pressures from outside its walls; as money and cameras rushed in								
independent minds fell more and more in line with the partisans. Rough parity between the two parties meant that every								
election had the potential to make or break a majority	 crushing the incentive to cooperate across the aisle. The Senate							
no longer a fount of ideas	 became a backwater of the U.S. government. During the Clinton years	 the main action was						
between the White House and the Gingrich House of Representatives; during the Bush years	 the Republican Senate							
majority abdicated the oversight role that could have placed a vital check on executive power.								
Norman Ornstein	 a congressional expert at the American Enterprise Institute	 said that the Senate has increasingly						
become populated by ""ideologues and charlatans."" He went on	 ""When we do get good people who come in	 they very						
quickly get ground up by the dynamic and the culture of the parties. And once you get there	 look at what it takes to stay							
there."" He spoke of Charles Grassley	 the Iowa Republican	 who	 nearing the end of his career	 spent much of last year				
working closely with his friend Max Baucus on the health-care bill. Then	 in August	 Grassley went home and	 faced with					
angry Republican voters and the prospect of a primary challenge from the right	 started warning about ""pulling the plug on							
Grandma."" Ornstein added that similar pressures had led John McCain to begin ""altering his behavior and abandoning								
every issue	 including campaign-finance reform.""							
One morning in April	 I visited Harry McPherson	 the former L.B.J. aide	 at the offices of the legal and lobbying firm D. L.					
A. Piper	 in downtown Washington. McPherson	 who is eighty	 had on his desk the firm's spiral-bound directory for the					
111th Congress. I asked him who	 in Johnsonian terms	 were the whales of the current Senate. McPherson ran his finger						
down the list of senators. He did it again. ""I'm trying here	 looking for a remote descendant. Judas Priest	 look at this."" He						
was stumped. ""Well	 I see some good people	 I see some people who are going to get coalitions together over time."" He						
put the directory aside. ""I'm just having the damnedest time.""								
Down the hall from McPherson's office was that of Mel Martinez	 a former Republican senator from Florida; he was hired							
last year	 two weeks after resigning his Senate seat without completing his first term. (He has since moved on to							
JPMorgan Chase.) William Cohen	 the former Maine senator and Secretary of Defense	 has an office downstairs. Tom						
Daschle works at D. L. A. Piper; his predecessor as Democratic leader	 George Mitchell	 was the firm's chairman	 until					
President Obama appointed him to be his Middle East envoy. One feature of the diminished U.S. senator is the ease with								
which he moves from legislating to lobbying. Between 1998 and 2004	 half the senators who left office became lobbyists.							
In 2007	 Trent Lott	 a Republican leader in the Senate less than a year into his fourth term	 abruptly resigned and formed					
a lobbying firm with former Senator John Breaux	 just a few weeks before a new law took effect requiring a two-year							
waiting period between serving and lobbying.								
When you spend your days at the Senate	 it's easy to forget about everything else. The House of Representatives seems							
miles away (it's just down a corridor and across the rotunda)	 the White House is another country	 and actual foreign						
countries are unimaginable. The place remains insular	 labyrinthine	 and opaque—even physically. Senators commute						
thirty seconds between their offices and the chamber by electric subway cars that run along a tunnel under Constitution								
Avenue. Many signs are misleading or obsolete (the gilded lettering over the visitors' gallery says ""Men's Gallery"")	 and							
the Capitol is filled with secret passageways and spare rooms	 called hideaways	 doled out according to seniority	 where					
senators can read	 drink	 doze	 and wait for the buzzer announcing an imminent vote. The most pervasive authority over					
the institution is not the Constitution or the Bible but	 rather	 an impenetrable sixteen-hundred-page tome	 by Floyd M.					
Riddick	 called ""Senate Procedure: Precedents and Practices	 which only the late Robert Byrd	 of West Virginia	 was				
known to have read in its entirety. The procedures are so abstruse that a parliamentarian must sit below the presiding								
officer and	 essentially	 tell him or her what to say.						
After half a century	 the picture given by Preminger's ""Advise and Consent"" is still faintly visible. ""The Senate	 by its						
nature	 is a place where consensus reigns and personal relationships are paramount	 Lamar Alexander said. ""And that's						
not changed."" Which is exactly the problem: it's a self-governing body that depends on the reasonableness of its								
members to function. Sarah Binder	 a congressional scholar at George Washington University	 said	 ""To have a chamber					
that rules by unanimous consent—it's nutty! Especially when you've got Jim Bunning to please.""								
In 2006 and 2008	 sixteen Democrats entered the Senate	 giving the Party its current majority of fifty-nine to forty-one						
(counting two independents). They include moderates	 like Jon Tester	 of Montana	 and Mark Warner	 of Virginia; liberals				
like Sherrod Brown	 of Ohio	 and Sheldon Whitehouse	 of Rhode Island; policy specialists	 like Amy Klobuchar	 of			
Minnesota	 and Jeff Merkley; and iconoclasts	 like Claire McCaskill. Their interest in legislating has won the admiration of						
senior senators. ""If they can stay	 I think they'll be terrific	 Chris Dodd said. ""My worry is they won't stay. Because it's not						
productive.""								
The Democratic class of 2008 arrived with President Obama	 expecting to usher in 6 dynamic new era. Instead	 their						
young Senate careers have passed in a daily slog of threatened filibusters and ""secret holds""—when a senator								
anonymously objects to bringing an appointment up for a vote	 which requires unanimous consent. On April 20th	 Claire						
McCaskill took the trouble to read off the names of fifty-six Obama nominees languishing in the limbo of secret holds	 and							
Jon Kyl objected to every one of them. Just getting a bill to the floor for debate can require days of tactical gamesmanship								
between the party leaders. There were times when Warner wondered if anyone had ever quit in the first year. Michael								
Bennet said	 ""We find ourselves at a moment in our history when the questions are huge ones	 not small ones	 and where					
things have been put off for a really long period of time."" He mentioned the national debt	 energy policy	 and the financial						
crisis. ""Yet you have a Senate that's designed not to advance change but to slow it.""								
We were talking in his hideaway	 a windowless room in the Capitol basement	 which had a mini-fridge stocked with bottled						
water	 black leatherette furniture circa 1962	 and a TV tuned to C-SPAN2 on mute; Senator Kyl's mouth was moving.						
Bennet	 the former superintendent of schools in Denver	 was appointed to a vacant seat in 2009	 and already has to					
defend it this year. He described the Senate with the dry bluntness of an outsider who hasn't allowed himself to grow too								
attached. Bennet repeated a story he had heard. about a new congressman giving his maiden speech: ""And then some								
more veteran guy came over and said	 'Son	 you're talking like this place is on the level. It's not on the level.' As the fifteen						
months or so have gone by that I've been here	 the less on the level it seems.""							
Earlier this year	 the Senate's procedural absurdities became national news twice in one month. On February 4th							
Con gressDaily reported that Richard Shelby	 an Alabama Republican	 was secretly blocking the confirmation of seventy						
Obama appointees over a dispute involving defense earmarks for his•state. (His tactics exposed	 Shelby—whose office							
maintains that he was responsible for fewer than fifty holds—lifted all but three.) Later that month	 Bunning spent several							
days and a late night on the Senate floor	 filibustering to prevent benefits from being paid to millions of unemployed							
Americans. When Merkley tried to reason with him	 Bunning responded	 ""Tough shit."" (Eventually	 Republicans persuaded					
Bunning to stop.)								
These incidents elicited a brief outcry	 but the extent of the Senate's routine folly remains largely hidden. For example							
Grassley and Ron Wyden	 of Oregon	 have been trying since 1997 to end the practice of secret holds	 without success. In					
2007	 the Senate passed a bill banning secret holds that last longer than six days. But to get around the ban two or more							
senators can pass the hold back and forth—it's called ""rolling holds""—and their party leader facilitates the game by								
keeping their names secret.								
Many of the Senate's antique rules and precedents have been warped beyond recognition by the modern pressures of								
partisanship. The hold	 for example	 was a courtesy extended to senators in the days of horse travel	 when they needed					
time to get back to Washington and read a bill or question an appointee before casting their vote. Sarah Binder	 who co-							
authored a book on the filibuster	 calls the procedure a historical accident: in 1806	 the Senate got rid of a little-used rule						
that allowed the ""previous question"" to be called to a vote. Suddenly	 there was no inherent limit on debate	 and by the						
eighteen-thirties senators had begun taking advantage of this loophole	 derailing the proceedings by getting up and talking							
until their voice	 legs	 or bladder gave out. (The word ""filibuster' comes from vrijbuiter—old Dutch for ""looter."")						
In 1917	 Woodrow Wilson	 with his wartime legislative agenda blocked by filibusters	 forced the Senate to pass Rule XXII					
which allowed a two-thirds majority to bring a floor debate to an end with a ""cloture"" vote. For decades	 the rule was rarely							
used; between 1919 and 1971	 there were only forty-nine cloture votes	 fewer than one per year. In the seventies and						
eighties	 the annual average rose to about a dozen. (Frustration with this increase led the Senate	 in 1975	 to lower the					
threshold for cloture to sixty votes.) In the nineties and early aughts	 the average went up to twenty-five or thirty a year	 as						
both parties escalated their use of the filibuster when they found themselves in the minority. After the Republicans lost								
their majority in 2006	 filibusters became everyday events: there were a hundred and twelve cloture votes in 2007 and							
2008	 and this session Republicans are on target to break their own filibuster record.							
The tally of cloture votes reflects only a small fraction of senatorial obstruction. Three hundred and forty-five bills passed								
by the House have been prevented from even coming up for debate in the Senate. ""Why?"" Steny Hoyer	 the outraged							
Democratic Majority Leader of the House	 asked me. ""Because they do not do their business in a way that facilitates							
noncontroversial things. Thankfully	 the House of Representatives is not becoming the Senate."" Last week	 six House						
Democrats expressed their displeasure with the upper chamber by staging a sit-in of sorts on the Senate floor.								
Seventy-six nominees for judgeships and executive posts have been approved by committees but	 because of blocks							
haven't come up for a vote in the full Senate	 leaving courtrooms idle and jobs unfilled across the upper levels of the							
Obama Administration. (The Democrats also practiced the art of blocking nominees during the Bush Administration.)								
There's often no objection to the individual being blocked: after an eight-month hold	 Martha Johnson	 nominated to run						
the General Services Administration	 was confirmed 96-0. On an issue like health-care reform	 when the objection was						
substantive	 Republicans ransacked Riddick's ""Senate Procedure"" for every conceivable way to delay a debate and vote.							
Judd Gregg even sent a memo on stalling tactics to his Republican colleagues. Tom Coburn demanded the reading aloud								
of an entire seven-hundred-and-sixty-seven-page amendment proposed by Bernie Sanders	 the Vermont socialist; Senate							
clerks	 working in half-hour shifts	 were three hours into the chore when Sanders withdrew the amendment in frustration.						
Under McConnell	 Republicans have consistently consumed as much of the Senate's calendar as possible with legislative							
maneuvering. The strategy is not to extend deliberation of the Senate's agenda but to prevent it. Tom Harkin	 who first							
proposed reform of the filibuster in 1995	 called his Republican colleagues ""nihilists	 who want to create chaos because it						
serves their ideology. ""If there's chaos	 things will tend toward simple solutions	 Harkin said. ""In chaos people don't listen						
to reason."" McConnell did not respond to requests for an interview	 but he has often argued that the Republican strategy							
reflects the views of a majority of Americans. In March	 he told the Times	 ""To the extent that they""—the Democrats—						
want to do things that we think are in the political center and would be helpful to the country	 we'll be helpful. To the							
extent they are trying to turn us into a Western European country	 we are not going to be helpful.""							
One of the mysteries of the Senate is how Mitch McConnell has been able to keep his members in line	 on vote after vote.							
Why do moderates with years of experience and their own power base back home—Richard Lugar	 of Indiana; Susan							
Collins	 of Maine; George Voinovich	 of Ohio—keep siding with the more extreme members of their caucus? Alexander						
said that McConnell listens well to all his members	 adding	 ""When you have your back against the wall and the gallows						
are hanging in front of you	 it tends to unify. Operating with forty members—it concentrates the mind.""							
Lindsey Graham described to the Times how McConnell exhorted his caucus after the disastrous 2008 election: ""He said								
if we didn't stick together on big things	 we wouldn't be relevant."" Last December	 the Republicans decided to filibuster a						
military-spending bill in order to delay the looming vote on health care until as close to Christmas as possible. Thad								
Cochran	 the Republican ranking member of the Appropriations Committee	 promised Daniel Inouye	 the chairman	 that				
he wouldn't join the effort. But at the last minute Cochran	 who has been in the Senate since 1979 and brings							
disproportionate amounts of defense money to Mississippi	 told Reid that his leadership wouldn't allow him to vote with							
the Democrats and end the filibuster—even on a matter of national security. (The Democrats were able to impose cloture								
and the vote on health care finally took place on Christmas Eve.)								
Republican defections have been rare. In early 2009	 Collins and Olympia Snowe	 also of Maine	 voted for the stimulus					
bill	 along with Arlen Specter (who promptly switched parties). Snowe also voted for the Finance Committee's health-care-							
reform bill last October	 the only Republican to do so. But in December	 at the pivotal moment	 she voted against the					
version that went before the full Senate. ""I wasn't interested in expanding this program beyond the Finance Committee								
version—it grew by a thousand pages	 Snowe said. She wasn't included in the negotiations with White House officials							
that took place in an elegant conference room across from Reid's suite of offices	 and said that the Democrats ""did not							
accept any of my proposals. As I said to the President	 it was all windup and no pitch."" McConnell was able to exploit her							
alienation. A friend of Snowe cited another reason for her reversal: ""She actually said to me once that she had never felt								
the pressure that she felt on health care	 never before had that pressure been quite as evident to her or quite as real or							
troubling. Kyl and McConnell were saying things like 'You just can't let us down	 we're all in this together. You're a senior							
Republican member of this caucus	 and you just have to hang tough with us. We expect it and you're going to do it.' ""							
Reid doesn't use such tough tactics; he has achieved his position	 in spite of his public shortcomings	 by being the senator						
who helped other Democrats	 always answered their calls	 and got them what they wanted through masterly						
maneuvering. This has made him enormously popular within the Democratic caucus	 but it doesn't give him the leverage							
of McConnell	 let alone of Lyndon Johnson.							
In the current Senate	 it has become normal for a handful of senators	 sometimes representing just ten or twenty per cent						
of the country's population	 to hold everything up. And the status quo has become sufficiently frustrating that a few new							
senators have considered a radical option: mutiny.								
Tom Udall	 who is sixty-two	 is older than most freshman senators. He has the crow's-feet of a Westerner who has spent						
time in the sun	 and a slow	 good-natured voice. His father	 Stewart	 was an Arizona congressman and the Interior				
Secretary for Presidents Kennedy and Johnson; his uncle Mo was a legendary Arizona representative; his cousin Mark is								
a freshman senator from Colorado. Udall served five terms in the House before winning a Senate seat from New Mexico								
in 2008. And yet he has the air of a political Candide—he is always earnest	 capable of disappointment but not cynicism.							
I ran on the idea that the Senate should not be a graveyard for good ideas	 he said. ""Then to be on the inside—the thing							
that strikes you is how one senator can hold up the whole show.""								
In his first year in office	 Udall decided to do something audacious: he would try to change the Senate's rules.							
Customarily	 the rules continue session after session	 and a provision in Rule XXII requires sixty-seven votes to amend						
them	 making it extremely difficult. (""Rule XXII is a Catch-22	 Ted Kennedy used to joke.) Udall embraced a different						
idea—the ""constitutional option."" Article I	 Section 5 of the Constitution states that ""each House may determine the Rules							
of its Proceedings"" at the beginning of the new Congress. So	 in theory	 a senator could take the floor next January and						
propose debating its rules from scratch	 including the filibuster. New rules could be passed with a simple majority. There's							
even a precedent for this: moves to revisit the rules by invoking the constitutional option have been made three times								
most recently in 1975. Udall has spent much of the past year trying to build support for the idea.								
At the request of Udall and others	 Schumer	 who is the chairman of the Rules Committee	 has held a series of hearings					
on the filibuster	 calling witnesses such as Sarah Binder	 the historian	 and Walter Mondale	 who was in the Senate when				
the constitutional option was invoked in 1975. Dick Durbin	 the second-highest-ranking Democrat	 has organized working						
groups among newer members on other internal reforms	 such as ending secret holds and choosing committee chairs by							
caucus vote rather than by seniority. (Lamar Alexander wryly suggested to me that Schumer and Durbin were competing								
for the favor of newer members	 in case Harry Reid loses his seat in the fall and they run against each other for Majority							
Leader.)								
For Republican institutionalists	 such as Alexander and Gregg	 the push for rules reform is folly. ""If you want a						
parliamentary form of government	 go over to the House	 Gregg	 who is about to retire	 scoffed. ""Why even run for the				
Senate?"" Udall's plan for next January	 he said	 would be a ""gigantic mistake.""						
They'll get over it	 Alexander said of the Democrats' enthusiasm for rules reform. ""And they'll get over it quicker if they're							
in the minority next January. Because they'll instantly see the value of slowing the Senate down to consider whatever they								
have to say."" He added that the Senate ""may be getting done about as much as the American people want done."" The								
President's ambitious agenda	 after all	 has upset a lot of voters	 across the political spectrum. None of the Republicans I					
spoke to agreed with the contention that the Senate is ""broken."" Alexander claimed that he and other Republicans were								
exercising the moderating	 thoughtful influence on legislation that the founders wanted in the Senate. ""The Senate wasn't							
created to be efficient	 he argued. ""It was created to be inefficient."" At one of the filibuster hearings	 in April	 Alexander					
sitting across the table from Udall	 said that	 for all the times the Democrats charge the Republicans with obstructing						
legislation	 ""we could say that's the number of times the majority has tried to cut off our right to debate	 our right to offer						
amendments	 which is the essence of the Senate.""							
Newcomers like Udall seem to think that the Senate has grown so absurd and extreme that some kind of reform is								
inevitable. Perhaps they need more time to plumb the depths of the institution's intransigence. According to Sarah Binder								
a change in rules is extremely unlikely; Republicans would be implacably opposed to	 say	 weakening the filibuster	 and					
so would some Democrats	 especially long-serving ones. ""I would oppose that	 Chris Dodd said	 adding of the freshmen					
These are people who have never been in the minority."" For older Democrats	 who have put in their years	 grown adept						
at working the rules	 and now chair powerful committees	 the reform impulse could be a threat. (Among senior senators						
the sole enthusiast for rules reform is Tom Harkin.) One senator spoke of the Senate as being divided not between								
whales and minnows but	 rather	 between bulls and calves. The older Democrats are too accustomed to the Senate's						
ways to share the frustrations of the newcomers; the handful of older moderate Republicans are too weak to challenge the								
newer radicals who now dominate the caucus.								
Even if the freshmen Democrats can somehow reform the filibuster next January	 the Senate will remain a sclerotic							
wasteful	 unhappy body. The deepest source of its problems is not rules and precedents but	 rather	 its human beings					
who have created a culture where Tocqueville's ""lofty thoughts"" and ""generous impulses"" have no place.								
A few days after passing health-care reform	 the Senate struggled to its feet to take on a second large task. Financial							
regulatory reform should have been the easiest piece of major legislation of the Obama Presidency	 the likeliest to win							
real bipartisan support. The financial crisis had been catastrophic for millions of Americans	 and after the 2008 bailout							
Wall Street had become even more hated than the Senate was. In April	 a lineup of bankers from Goldman Sachs							
appeared before Senator Levin's subcommittee on investigations	 and managed to appear as arrogant	 callous	 and					
evasive as their reputations had suggested. The public demanded action. Some Republicans had a genuine desire to								
pass a bill. If health-care reform had been a war of attrition	 financial reform was a promising liaison.							
The affair began with a Republican	 Bob Corker	 and a Democrat	 Mark Warner—both multimillionaires serving their first					
term	 both considered centrists. Corker is a small	 dapper former construction magnate who became the mayor of						
Chattanooga; Warner is a tall	 preppily dressed former telecommunications entrepreneur who became the governor of							
Virginia. Chris Dodd	 the Banking Committee chairman	 assigned them to work together on the section of the bill having to						
do with the liquidation of troubled firms—making sure that there would never be another taxpayer bailout. They worked								
through the winter	 in Warner's office	 in Corker's office	 over dinner	 sometimes without staff	 as if they were members of			
a Senate from the past. They hosted a series of afternoon seminars	 inviting guests such as Ben Bernanke	 Alan						
Greenspan	 and Sheila Bair. Corker and Warner were sometimes said to be the only Democrat and Republican still							
talking to each other. In January	 Business Week called them the Senate's ""Odd Couple."" By February	 they had finished						
their work.								
Meanwhile	 discussions about the entire bill between Dodd and Richard Shelby	 the top Republican on the committee						
dragged on	 repeatedly breaking down. Finally	 on February 10th	 Dodd called Corker	 who	 though he was one of the			
committee's junior members	 agreed to be the chairman's Republican negotiating partner. When Corker informed							
McConnell and Shelby	 they expressed surprise. ""It was an odd place to be	 Corker recalled. ""And yet that night we						
began meeting."" The junior Republican savored the rare experience of creating	 rather than opposing	 legislation. In						
response	 Shelby's conservative staff tried to undermine Corker	 spreading rumors among Republicans and their lobbyists						
that he was giving too much away. (A Shelby aide said that staff members were simply informing other Republicans of the								
Party's line on financial reform.)								
On March 10th	 Dodd concluded that he had to move a bill to the floor. He called Corker and said	 ""You've been a great						
partner."" He was ending their talks after only a month. ""It's a little stunning	 I've got to be honest	 Corker told reporters						
afterward. Someone close to the negotiations compared Corker to Dickens's Miss Havisham	 unable to get over the							
rebuff	 forever awaiting the arrival of her groom	 all her clocks stopped. Corker later said that Dodd had ended the talks						
under pressure from the White House and other Democrats. Dodd said that Corker had been unable to bring any other								
Republicans with him. ""Baloney	 Corker said. ""If Dodd had reached an agreement with me	 we'd've had at least twenty-						
five Republican votes.""								
The bill that Dodd brought before the Senate	 after a year of discussions with Democrats and Republicans alike							
incorporated the bipartisan plan of Warner and Corker to prevent another bank bailout: setting up a fifty-billion-dollar fund								
paid for by the banks	 to insure orderly liquidation	 and establishing a risk council to detect warning signs of another crisis.						
But in mid-April Mitch McConnell—who had just met with Wall Street executives in New York	 and was now parroting							
talking points from a memo written by the Republican strategist Frank Luntz—called it a ""partisan bill"" that ""will guarantee								
perpetual taxpayer bailout of Wall Street banks."" McConnell presented a letter	 signed by all forty-one Republicans							
suggesting that they would filibuster the financial-reform bill.								
His remarks amounted to a repudiation of Corker's work as well as of Dodd's. The next day	 April 15th	 Corker pleaded						
with his colleagues	 in his Tennessee twang	 ""Let's come to the floor and let's act like adults. Let's tone down the rhetoric.						
Let's don't exaggerate the pluses or minuses. Let's do what the Senate was created to do. . . . We were supposed to be								
the people that took some of the red-hot activities that sometimes come from the other body and sat down with cooler								
heads and resolved the issues like adults. We can do that. As a matter of fact	 I would say	 if we cannot do that on						
financial regulation	 an issue that really doesn't have any real philosophical bearings to it . . ."" Corker didn't allow the							
thought to ripen—he had already gone farther than almost any Republican would have dared.								
Dodd spoke later in the day and completed Corker's speech: ""I know my friends on the other side of the aisle are faced								
with a difficult choice between supporting their party leadership and participating in this complicated	 difficult debate. I am							
not naïve. I know that is a hard place to be. But if we can't act like U.S. senators for the sake of this issue . . . then why								
are we even here?"" He went on	 ""We work for an American public that is sick and tired of feeling like no one is looking out							
for their interests	 like the political hacks and lobbyists hold all the cards in these discussions. The minority seems intent							
on proving them right. . . . I have been here a long time. I know this institution is better than that. I know there are friends								
of mine on the other side of the aisle who care about this bill	 who want to be a part of the debate	 who want to be part of						
the solution.""								
In the same speech	 Dodd joined the partisan fight	 accusing McConnell of lying about the bill. Turning crimson-faced	 he					
chopped the air with his hand as he shouted	 ""I have to ask myself	 why did I go through this process over the last four or						
five months	 agreeing to much of what they were offering	 and there is not a single political vote to show for it. . . . I have						
to say to the younger members	 the newer members coming along: be careful!""							
Corker	 having heard that Dodd was speaking	 returned to the chamber and asked to respond. ""You and I went a long						
way	 Corker told Dodd. ""Then we stopped. On March 10th it ended. I understand that	 look	 you were losing Democrats					
on your committee.""								
And I was not gaining Republicans	 Dodd replied.							
You had one	 and that is all you asked for when you started. I never said I could speak for anybody but myself. And I did							
not leave the table."" Corker urged Dodd to keep talking to Republicans—their differences could be sorted out in a few								
days.								
But this was not McConnell's agenda. Instead	 financial reform became a slightly more polite repeat of the health-care-							
reform brawl: the Republicans threatened filibusters	 the Democrats threatened all-nighters	 and thousands of lobbyists						
prowled the Capitol	 charging their Wall Street clients more than a billion dollars. On April 28th	 I was sitting in the ornate						
Reception Room with Jim Manley	 Reid's spokesman. On the other side of the wall	 there was the noise of furniture						
scraping across a tile floor. ""Those are cots being set up in the L.B.J. Room	 Manley said. ""Very little happens around							
here without a deadline."" The cots persuaded Republicans to allow the bill to move to the floor for debate. A few weeks								
later	 on May 20th	 yet another filibuster was defeated by yet another cloture motion	 and financial reform finally came to a					
vote. It passed	 59-39. Only four Republicans had joined the majority. Corker wasn't among them. He had even voted for							
an amendment	 offered by his Republican colleague Jeff Sessions	 of Alabama	 that would have scrapped Corker's work					
of many months with Warner.								
The idea of watching Bob Corker vote for the Sessions amendment!"" Dodd said afterward	 sitting in his red-curtained							
office	 under a print of Holbein's portrait of Thomas More. ""It's the Senate	 I guess."" McConnell's strategy of obstruction						
had once again come close to succeeding	 Dodd said	 but he knew that a ""shrinking number"" of Republicans were						
frustrated. The previous day	 Dodd had said to Susan Collins	 ""God	 I would have loved to have you as my ranking					
member on this."" Collins responded	 ""We could have had such a great time on this bill.""							
Warner	 who said that he believed in bipartisanship because ""the American people don't trust either political party enough							
to give them a blank check	 was astonished that so few Republicans voted for financial reform. ""There was zero							
substantive reason why this couldn't have been eighty votes	 he said. I asked him why Bob Corker had voted no on the							
bill. Warner started to talk about the consumer-protection title	 and then said	 ""If you want to vote against something	 you					
can always find your reasons.""								
But Corker hadn't seemed to want to vote against it. He had spent months trying to act like a U.S. senator	 alienating							
himself from his own party and then the other party	 and on the day of the vote he held the floor for the better part of thirty							
minutes	 as if he were still reluctant to let the effort go. ""I am obviously disappointed	 he said. ""I think I have spent as						
much time as any senator. . . on policy regarding our financial system. I think any bill—even this bill—has good things in								
it. There is no question. And I appreciate the thrust. But I think there is a lot of overreaching	 and I think not enough time							
was spent on some of the core issues.""								
As the senators cast their votes	 I noticed Robert Kaiser	 the author of ""So Damn Much Money	 in the press gallery. I later					
asked him if	 with the passage of two big reform bills in three months	 we were witnessing a possible renewal of the						
Senate. ""If you can engage public opinion in a way politicians can understand	 public opinion can still blow away money							
and interest groups	 he said. ""But over the past few decades the reflex has grown in the Senate that	 all things						
considered	 it's better to avoid than to take on big issues. This is the kind of thing that drives Michael Bennet nutty: here							
you've arrived in the United States Senate and you can't do fuck-all about the destruction of the planet.""								
After the final vote on financial reform	 the Republicans flew home	 and the Democratic leaders held a press conference						
smiling before the microphones outside the Senate chamber. Reid said	 ""For those who wanted to protect Wall Street	 it						
didn't work."" He then excused himself: he had to join Biden for a telephone fund-raiser with ""some Nevadans.""								
Durbin said	 ""I was stunned that only four Republicans would join us in passing this historic legislation. What does it take							
to bring the Republican Party into the conversation about the future of America?""								
Dodd	 glowing with triumph	 said	 ""I wanted to demonstrate that the Senate of the United States could conduct its					
business much as our founders intended. We did that.""								
On July 21st	 President Obama signed the completed bill. The two lasting achievements of this Senate	 financial						
regulation and health care	 required a year and a half of legislative warfare that nearly destroyed the body. They							
depended on a set of circumstances—a large majority of Democrats	 a charismatic President with an electoral mandate							
and a national crisis—that will not last long or be repeated anytime soon. Two days after financial reform became law								
Harry Reid announced that the Senate would not take up comprehensive energy-reform legislation for the rest of the year.								
And so climate change joined immigration	 job creation	 food safety	 pilot training	 veterans' care	 campaign finance			
transportation security	 labor law	 mine safety	 wildfire management	 and scores of executive and judicial appointments on				
the list of matters that the world's greatest deliberative body is incapable of addressing. Already	 you can feel the Senate							
slipping back into stagnant waters.

The Political Scene
The Empty Chamber
Just how broken is the Senate?
Seventy-six nominees for judgeships and executive posts have been approved by committees but, because of blocks,
haven't come up for a vote in the full Senate, leaving courtrooms idle and jobs unfilled across the upper levels of the
Obama Administration....
The tally of cloture votes reflects only a small fraction of senatorial obstruction. Three hundred and forty-five bills passed
by the House have been prevented from even coming up for debate in the Senate....

Cit and watch us for seven days,"" one senator says of the deadlocked chamber. ""You know what you'll see happening?
Nothing.""

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770192 Date: 08/31/2015
'This is just one of those days when you want to throw up your hands and say, 'What in the world are we doing?'""
Senator Claire McCaskill, the Missouri Democrat, said.
""It's unconscionable,"" Carl Levin, the senior Democratic senator from Michigan, said. ""The obstructionism has become
mindless.""
The Senators were in the Capitol, sunk into armchairs before the marble fireplace in the press lounge, which is directly
behind the Senate chamber. It was four-thirty on a Wednesday afternoon. McCaskill, in a matching maroon jacket and
top, looked exasperated; Levin glowered over his spectacles.
""Also, it's a dumb rule in itself,"" McCaskill said. ""It's time we started looking at some of these rules.""
She was referring to Senate Rule XXVI, Paragraph 5, which requires unanimous consent for committees and
subcommittees to hold hearings after two in the afternoon while the Senate is in session. Both Levin and McCaskill had
scheduled hearings that day for two-thirty. Typically, it wouldn't be difficult to get colleagues to waive the rule; a general
and an admiral had flown halfway around the world to appear before Levin's Armed Services Committee, and McCaskill's
Subcommittee on Contracting Oversight of the Homeland Security Committee was investigating the training of Afghan
police. But this was March 24th, the day after President Barack Obama signed the health-care-reform bill, in a victory
ceremony at the White House; it was also the day that the Senate was to vote on a reconciliation bill for health-care
reform, approved by the House three nights earlier, which would retroactively remove the new law's most embarrassing
sweetheart deals and complete the yearlong process of passing universal health care. Republicans, who had fought the
bill as a bloc, were in no mood to make things easy.
So, four hours earlier, when Levin went to the Senate floor and asked for consent to hold his hearing, Senator Richard
Burr, Republican of North Carolina, and a member of Levin's committee, had refused. ""I have no personal objection to
continuing,"" Burr said. But, he added, ""there is objection on our side of the aisle. Therefore, I would have to object.""
Burr had to object on behalf of his party because he was the only Republican in the chamber when Levin spoke. In
general, when senators give speeches on the floor, their colleagues aren't around, and the two or three who might be
present aren't listening. They're joking with aides, or e-mailing Twitter ideas to their press secretaries, or getting their first
look at a speech they're about to give before the eight unmanned cameras that provide a live feed to C-SPAN2. The
presiding officer of the Senate—freshmen of the majority party take rotating, hour-long shifts intended to introduce them to
the ways of the institution—sits in his chair on the dais, scanning his BlackBerry or reading a Times article about the
Senate. Michael Bennet, a freshman Democrat from Colorado, said, ""Sit and watch us for seven days—just watch the
floor. You know what you'll see happening? Nothing. When I'm in the chair, I sit there thinking, I wonder what they're
doing in China right now?""
Between speeches, there are quorum calls, time killers in which a Senate clerk calls the roll at the rate of one name every
few minutes. The press gallery, above the dais, is typically deserted, as journalists prefer to hunker down in the press
lounge, surfing the Web for analysis of current Senate negotiations; television screens alert them if something of interest
actually happens in the chamber. The only people who pay attention to a speech are the Senate stenographers. On this
afternoon, two portly bald men in suits stood facing the speaker from a few feet away, tapping at the transcription
machines, which resembled nineteenth-century cash registers, slung around their necks. The Senate chamber is an
intimate room where men and women go to talk to themselves for the record.
Like many other aspects of senatorial procedure, Rule XXVI, Paragraph 5 is a relic from the days when senators had to
hover around their desks to know what was happening on the floor during the main afternoon debate. (The desks, some
built as long ago as 1819, are mahogany, and their lids lift up, like those in an old schoolhouse; the desks of the Majority
and Minority Leader are still equipped with brass spittoons.) In the press lounge, McCaskill said, with light sarcasm,
""Somebody told me the rule is to make sure people pay attention to what's happening on the floor during debate and not
be distracted by committee work. Clearly, it's an old rule.""
The Republicans had turned this old rule into a new means of obstruction. There would be no hearings that afternoon; the
general and the admiral would have to come back another day. Like investment bankers on Wall Street, senators these
days direct much of their creative energy toward the manipulation of arcane rules and loopholes, scoring short-term
successes while magnifying their institution's broader dysfunction.
Around five o'clock, the chamber began to fill, as the reconciliation bill came up for a vote; there were twenty-three
amendments pending, all from Republicans, and perhaps many more to come. Ordinarily, debate and voting on an
amendment might take two legislative days, but under the rules of the reconciliation bill the senators were to dispatch the
amendments one after another, as in a hot-dog-eating contest, with a minute of debate for each side. The goal was to
finish the bill by the end of the evening, so that senators wouldn't miss a day of their spring recess—apparently, the only
thing worse than a government takeover of the health-care system. The usual longueurs of the Senate, where forty
minutes can tick away on the antique clock above the rear double doors without a word's being spoken, were about to
yield to a frenzy. Harry Reid, the Majority Leader, from Nevada, had predicted that the process, known as Vote-O-Rama,
would go past two in the morning, and had warned senators to stay close to the chamber.
Max Baucus, of Montana, the manager of the bill for the Democrats, rose and said, ""This is the first time in recent memory
that a reconciliation bill has all the amendments on one side only. These are clearly amendments designed to kill the
reconciliation and, therefore, kill health-care reform. So I very much hope that all of these amendments are defeated.""
Tall, gaunt Judd Gregg, of New Hampshire, the bill's Republican manager, took the floor. ""The position on the other side
of the aisle is: no amendments allowed, even if they are good,"" he said. Indignation rouged his cheeks, and his voice rose
half an octave. ""Obviously, they presume the Republican Party is an inconvenience. The democratic process is an

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770192 Date: 08/31/2015
inconvenience. It also appears, considering the opposition to this out in America, that the American people are an
inconvenience.""
The Senate chamber is laid out in four concentric semicircles, with adjacent desks almost touching on the crowded
Democratic side, and the desks of the much smaller Republican minority spaced loosely apart. The design is meant to
emphasize the senators' unity. But Baucus and Gregg avoided eye contact across the six feet of aisle that now divides the
chamber into two constantly warring factions. Senators are required, by custom, to speak of one another in the third
person, directing their anger and sarcasm through whichever poor freshman happens to be the presiding officer at the
moment. Rule XIX, Paragraphs 2 and 3—one of the original rules drawn from Thomas Jefferson's ""Manual of
Parliamentary Practice""—bars senators from imputing unworthy conduct or motives to another senator, and from insulting
any senator's state. But there is no rule against finger-wagging, and Baucus wagged his at Gregg while shouting at Al
Franken, of Minnesota, who had started a shift in the presiding officer's chair: ""Mr. President, make no mistake, the intent
of every single one of the amendments offered on the other side of the aisle is to kill health-care reform. . . . A senator on
the other side of the aisle stood up and said that this is hopefully the President's Waterloo. They want to kill health-care
reform!""
The voice of Stuart Smalley filled the chamber: ""The time of the senator has expired.""
For the next nine hours, the chamber became the stage of a theatrical whose ending, like almost everything that happens
on the Senate floor, was known in advance to all. The Republican goal in Vote-O-Rama was to embarrass the Democrats
while appearing to suggest useful changes; the Democratic goal was to prevent any change to the bill, so that it wouldn't
have to return to the House, where it might be voted down. Several of the Republican amendments had been designed to
make Democrats look hypocritical, by forcing them to vote against policies that the Party typically supports. One
amendment, for example, declared that the health-care bill could not be linked to a tax hike on individuals making less
than two hundred thousand dollars a year. Other amendments were more nakedly partisan, and outlandish. David Vitter, a
Louisiana Republican, proposed an amendment that repealed the entire law. Senator Tom Coburn, a Republican
obstetrician from Oklahoma, introduced an amendment to insure that veterans diagnosed with mental illness would not be
denied the right to own firearms, and another to prevent ""convicted child molesters, rapists, and sex offenders"" from
buying erectile-dysfunction drugs with taxpayer funds. Coburn got through the minute he was allotted to explain his Viagra
amendment without cracking a smile. ""This is not a game amendment,"" he insisted. ""It actually saves money.""
So many senators snickered that the presiding officer banged his gavel for order.
""The amendment offered by the senator from Oklahoma makes a mockery of this Senate,"" Baucus declared. ""It is a crass
political stunt aimed at making thirty-second commercials, not public policy."" Baucus asked for the yeas and nays, and a
clerk called the roll at a ragged pace. ""Mr. Coburn, Mr. Cochran, Ms. Collins."" Thirty-five-second pause. ""Mr. Conrad, Mr.
Corker."" Ten seconds. ""Mr. Cornyn."" Senators pay no attention to the sound of their name; they cast votes when they're
so inclined—wandering in late, shuffling down the chamber's gentle blue-carpeted steps to the swarm of colleagues
milling about in the well, where the clerks sit at a table, and then holding a finger up or down. At one point, John McCain—
now just one of a hundred senators and struggling to stay in office—spent half a minute waving stiff-armed, trying to catch
the eye of a clerk so he could cast his vote. In the end, two Democrats—Evan Bayh, of Indiana, and Ben Nelson, of
Nebraska—joined the Republicans in opposing Viagra for sex offenders. The amendment was defeated.
The carpeting in the chamber absorbs voices, and during the long night one of the few that rose above the muffled drone
was that of Charles Schumer, who said to Gregg, ""Get to work! Stop screwing around with health care!"" Sporadically, a
sharp cackle emanated from Al Franken, who wandered the chamber, looking for Republicans he could charm into
laughing. Observed from the press gallery, the senators in their confined space began to resemble zoo animals—Levin a
shambling brown bear, John Thune a loping gazelle, Jim Bunning a maddened grizzly. Each one displayed a limited set of
behaviors: in conversations, John Kerry planted himself a few inches away, loomed, and clamped his hands down on a
colleague's shoulders. Joe Lieberman patted everyone on the back. It became clear which senators were loners (Russ
Feingold, Daniel Akaka) and which were social (Blanche Lincoln, Lindsey Graham); which senators were important (Dick
Durbin, Jon Kyl) and which were ignored (Bayh, Bunning).
Past midnight, Durbin slumped at his desk, one hand over his face, yawning painfully. Susan Collins was going through
her mail. Twenty-three amendments had been voted down, and the Republicans were proposing a fresh batch. ""Can we
get some order?"" Bunning growled, before he introduced a proposal to let senior citizens opt out of parts of Medicare. It
was the only amendment that any Republicans joined the Democrats to defeat.
Harry Reid controls the Senate's schedule, but Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, who is the Minority Leader, can object.
Since nearly everything in the Senate depends on unanimous consent, the main business of the place is a continuous
negotiation between these two supremely unsentimental men. That night, they played a game of chicken: McConnell,
unsmiling, his eyes riveted ahead, held out the prospect of dozens more amendments; Reid, a former boxer, was
hunched and mumbling, playing rope-a-dope, vowing to fend off amendments all night. The two leaders left the chamber
to confer privately about how to proceed. Inside, the atmosphere of a slumber party set in. Debbie Stabenow, of Michigan,
her hand across her heart, sang a sentimental duet with Robert Menendez, of New Jersey. Exhaustion momentarily
eased the partisan divide. Claire McCaskill sat down beside Tom Coburn, held up an erect finger in his face, as if casting
her Viagra vote, then let it go limp. Coburn could be heard to joke, ""The longest it lasted was thirty seconds.""
At two-forty-five in the morning, Reid suddenly declared the Senate adjourned. The Senate parliamentarian had just found
two small violations of the reconciliation rules, meaning that in the morning, despite the Democrats' efforts, the bill would
go back to the House for another vote. At the bang of the gavel, the senators fled. In the parking lot, on the Capitol's

northeast side, McCaskill climbed into her S.U.V. Levin, in a cramped sedan, was chauffeured off into the empty streets.
On a marble ledge near the exit, Arlen Specter sat alone, a ghost in a brown suit, staring straight ahead, as if waiting for
someone to take him away.
The Senate reconvened at 9:45 A.M. Around two in the afternoon, the members gathered for the final vote, and the
Democrats were giddy. Tom Harkin, of Iowa, and Christopher Dodd, of Connecticut, even exchanged a hug. ""Everyone's
tired,"" Reid declared before the final vote. ""This legislative fight is one for the record books."" He was so fatigued that he
initially voted the wrong way. Lindsey Graham came in late, delaying the tally by ten minutes. ""Way to go, Lindsey, way to
stretch it out,"" Sam Brownback told him. A few Republicans lingered and took in the moment, like players on the losing
team at the end of the World Series. After a year of work, health-care reform had passed, 56-43, and for a moment the
chamber's Tweeting pygmies had become legislative giants.
The Senate is often referred to as ""the world's greatest deliberative body."" Jeff Merkley, a freshman Democrat from
Oregon, said, ""That is a phrase that I wince each time I hear it, because the amount of real deliberation, in terms of
exchange of ideas, is so limited."" Merkley could remember witnessing only one moment of floor debate between a
Republican and a Democrat. ""The memory I took with me was: 'Wow, that's unusual—there's a conversation occurring in
which they're making point and counterpoint and challenging each other.' And yet nobody else was in the chamber.""
Tom Udall, a freshman Democrat from New Mexico, could not recall seeing a senator change another senator's mind.
""You would really need a good hour or two of extensive exchange among folks that really know the issue,"" he said.
Instead, a senator typically gives ""a prepared speech that's already been vetted through the staff. Then another guy gets
up and gives a speech on a completely different subject."" From time to time, senators of the same party carry on a
colloquy—""I would be interested in the distinguished senator from Iowa's view of the other side's Medicare Advantage
plan""—that has been scripted in advance by aides.
While senators are in Washington, their days are scheduled in fifteen-minute intervals: staff meetings, interviews, visits
from lobbyists and home-state groups, caucus lunches, committee hearings, briefing books, floor votes, fund-raisers.
Each senator sits on three or four committees and even more subcommittees, most of which meet during the same
morning hours, which helps explain why committee tables are often nearly empty, and why senators drifting into a hearing
can barely sustain a coherent line of questioning. All this activity is crammed into a three-day week, for it's an unwritten
rule of the modern Senate that votes are almost never scheduled for Mondays or Fridays, which allows senators to spend
four days away from the capital. Senators now, unlike those of several decades ago, often keep their families in their
home states, where they return most weekends, even if it's to Alaska or Idaho—a concession to endless fund-raising, and
to the populist anti-Washington mood of recent years. (When Newt Gingrich became Speaker of the House, in 1995, he
told new Republican members not to move their families to the capital.) Tom Daschle, the former Democratic leader, said,
""When we scheduled votes, the only day where we could be absolutely certain we had all one hundred senators there
was Wednesday afternoon.""
Nothing dominates the life of a senator more than raising money. Tom Harkin, the Iowa Democrat, said, ""Of any free time
you have, I would say fifty per cent, maybe even more,"" is spent on fund-raising. In addition to financing their own
campaigns, senators participate at least once a week in the Power Hour, during which they make obligatory calls on
behalf of the Party (in the Democrats' case, from a three-story town house across Constitution Avenue from the Senate
office buildings, since they're barred from using their own offices to raise money). Lamar Alexander, the Tennessee
Republican, insisted that the donations are never sufficient to actually buy a vote, but he added, ""It sucks up time that a
senator ought to be spending getting to know other senators, working on issues.""
In June, 2009, top aides to Max Baucus, whose Finance Committee was negotiating the health-care-reform bill, took time
to meet with two health-care lobbyists, who themselves were former Baucus aides. (Baucus received more than a million
dollars from the industry for his 2008 reelection campaign.) That month, according to Common Cause, industry groups
were spending $1.4 million a day to lobby members of Congress. Udall, speaking of the corrosive effect of fund-raising
and lobbying, said, ""People know it in their heart—they know this place is dominated by special interests. The over-all bills
are not nearly as bold because of the influence of money.""
Deschle sketched a portrait of the contemporary senator who is too busy to think: ""Sometimes, you're dialling for dollars,
you get the call, you've got to get over to vote, you've got fifteen minutes. You don't have a clue what's on the floor, your
staff is whispering in your ears, you're running onto the floor, then you check with your leader—you double check—but,
just to make triple sure, there's a little sheet of paper on the clerk's table: The leader recommends an aye vote, or a no
vote. So you've got all these checks just to make sure you don't screw up, but even then you screw up sometimes. But, if
you're ever pressed, 'Why did you vote that way?'—you just walk out thinking, Oh, my God, I hope nobody asks, because
I don't have a clue.""
Aides, at the elbows of senators as they shuttle between their offices and the Capitol, have proliferated over the past few
decades, and they play a crucial role. Lamar Alexander, who has an office of fifty people, pointed out that staff members,
who are younger and often more ideological than their bosses, and less dependent on institutional relationships, tend to
push senators toward extremes. Often, aides are the main actors behind proposed legislation—writing bills, negotiating
the details—while the senator is relegated to repeating talking points on Fox' or MSNBC.
One day in his office, Udall picked up some tabloids from his coffee table and waved them at me. ""You know about all
these rags that cover the Hill, right?"" he said, smiling. There are five dailies—Politico, The Hill, Roll Call, Con gressDaily,
and CQ Today—all of which emphasize insider conflict. The senators, who like to complain about the trivializing effect of
the ""24/7 media,"" provide no end of fodder for it. The news of the day was what Udall called a ""dust-up"" between Scott

Brown, the freshman Massachusetts Republican, and a staffer for Jim DeMint, the arch-conservative from South Carolina;
the staffer had Tweeted that Brown was voting too often with the Democrats, leading Brown to confront DeMint on the
Senate floor over this supposed breach of protocol. Bloggers carry so much influence that many senators have a young
press aide dedicated to the care and feeding of online media. News about, by, and for a tiny kingdom of political
obsessives dominates the attention of senators and staff, while stories that might affect their constituents go unreported
because their home-state papers can no longer afford to have bureaus in Washington. Dodd, who came to the Senate in
1981 and will leave next January, told me, ""I used to have eleven Connecticut newspaper reporters who covered me on a
daily basis. I don't have one today, and haven't had one in a number of years. Instead, D.C. publications only see me
through the prism of conflict."" Lamar Alexander described the effect as ""this instant radicalizing of positions to the left and
the right.""
Both Alexander and Gregg said that the Senate had been further polarized by the rising number of senators—now nearly
fifty—who come from the House, rather than from governorships or other positions where bipartisan coOperation is still
permissible. ""A lot of senators don't understand the history or tradition of the institution,"" Gregg said. ""Substantive,
thoughtful, moderate discussion is pushed aside.""
Encumbered with aides, prodded by hourly jolts from electronic media, racing from the hearing room to the caucus lunch
to the Power Hour to the airport, senators no longer have the time, or perhaps the inclination, to get to know one
another—least of all, members of the other party. Friendships across party lines are more likely among the few spouses
who live in Washington. After Udall joined the Senate, last year, he was invited to dinner by Alexander, because Jill
Cooper Udall and Honey Alexander had become friends through a women's social club. It remains the only time Udall has
set foot in the house of a Republican senator. (Vice-President Joe Biden, in his autobiography, recalls that, in the
seventies, a bipartisan group of senators and their wives hosted a monthly dinner: ""In those days Democrats and
Republicans actually enjoyed each other's company."") When I asked Chris Dodd how well he knew, for example, Jim
DeMint, Dodd said, ""Not at all. Whereas Jesse Helms and I knew each other pretty well."" He repeated something that Jon
Kyl, the Republican whip, from Arizona, had recently said to him: ""There's no trust."" Dodd, whose father was a senator,
went on, ""That's really all there is—this place really operates on that. I don't think anyone would argue with that
conclusion. And if that's missing.
There remains a veneer—badly chipped—of comity. On the floor, senators still refer to members of the opposing party as
""friends."" Gregg described Kent Conrad, a Democrat from North Dakota, as ""one of my best friends in the Senate,"" and
both Gregg and Alexander ticked off examples of little-known legislation that they are currently working on with
Democrats; Alexander and Ben Cardin, of Maryland, have introduced a bill to ban mountaintop-removal coal mining. Udall
noted that he had become friendly with John McCain when they went on a congressional tour of Iraq. But opportunities to
bond are rare. On the first floor of the Capitol, there is a private dining room for senators, the ""inner sanctum,"" where
Republicans and Democrats used to have lunch (at separate tables, but in the same room). In the seventies, old bulls
such as James Eastland, Hubert Humphrey, and Jacob Javits held court there; later, Daniel Patrick Moynihan did. ""You
learned, and also you found out what was going on,"" Dodd said, adding, ""It's awfully difficult to say crappy things about
someone that you just had lunch with."" These days, the inner sanctum is nearly always empty. Senators eat lunch in their
respective caucus rooms with members of their party, or else ""downtown,"" which means asking donors for money over
steak and potatoes at the Monocle or Charlie Palmer. The tradition of the ""caucus lunch"" was instituted by Republicans in
the fifties, when they lost their majority; Democrats, after losing theirs in 1980, followed suit. Caucus lunches work
members on both sides into a state of pep-rally fervor. During one recent Republican lunch, Jim Bunning referred to Harry
Reid as an idiot. ""At least he had the courtesy to do it behind closed doors,"" Alexander joked, adding, ""We spend most of
our time in team meetings deciding what we're going to do to each other.""
In 2007, Alexander and Lieberman started a series of bipartisan Tuesday breakfasts. ""They kind of dwindled off during the
health-care debate,"" Alexander said. Udall has tried to revive the Wednesday inner-sanctum lunch. For the first few
months, only Democrats attended. Then, one Wednesday in May, Susan Collins, the Maine Republican, showed up,
joking nervously about being a turncoat; to protect her reputation, her presence was kept secret.
These efforts at resurrecting dead customs are as self-conscious and, probably, as doomed as the get-togethers of lovers
who try to stay friends after a breakup. Ira Shapiro, a Washington lawyer and a former aide to Senator Gaylord Nelson, of
Wisconsin, put it this way: ""Why would they want to have lunch together when they hate each other?""
The upper chamber of Congress was a constitutional compromise between popular sovereignty and state sovereignty.
The Senate was designed, as part of the separation of powers, to check the impulses of the House and the popular will.
For some Federalists, it also had an aristocratic purpose: to collect knowledge and experience, and to guard against a
levelling spirit that might overtake the majority. When Alexis de Tocqueville visited the Senate, in 1832, he was deeply
impressed by the quality of its members: ""They represent only the lofty thoughts [of the nation] and the generous instincts
animating it, not the petty passions."" But he also recognized that ""a minority of the nation dominating the Senate could
completely paralyze the will of the majority represented in the other house, and that is contrary to the spirit of
constitutional government."" As long as the Senate continued to be composed of America's most talented statesmen,
Tocqueville implied, it would restrain its own anti-democratic potential.
Robert A. Caro, in ""Master of the Senate,"" the third volume of his life of Lyndon Johnson, argues that after the Civil War •
the Senate was captured by wealthy and sectional interests, ending a more high-minded age when Daniel Webster, Henry
Clay, and John C. Calhoun engaged in brilliant debate. Aside from spasms of legislation at the start of the Presidencies of
Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt, Caro writes, the Senate remained controlled by an alliance of Southern racists

and Republican corporate shills, and was ""the dam against which the waves of social reform dashed themselves in vain—
the chief obstructive force in the federal government."" By the fifties, the Senate had become far more conservative than
the public. And not just conservative: William S. White, in his 1956 book ""Citadel,"" called the Senate ""to a most peculiar
degree, a Southern Institution . . . growing at the heart of this ostensibly national assembly"" and ""the only place in the
country where the South did not lose the war.""
By mid-century, it had become a journalistic cliché to call the Senate broken. Otto Preminger's 1962 film ""Advise and
Consent,"" based on the novel by Allen Drury, is about the Senate of that period, and it presents Democrats and
Republicans as equally amoral, calculating, and power-hungry. But the institution, as depicted by Preminger, still works, in
its way: though the deals stink, they get cut. The senators know their colleagues and the rules; they back-stab one
another in the lunchroom, then drink cocktails and play cards on Saturday nights. There are no lobbyists, no fund-raisers,
no media, no constituents—only senators' intricate relations with one another. The Senate is its own world.
In a memoir, Johnson's longtime aide Harry McPherson recalls learning that the Senate's ""famous 'club' atmosphere is
based on the members' mutual acceptance of responsibility and concentration on the tasks at hand. . . . They thrust hard
at one another in debate over serious matters,"" but, he writes, ""understanding and accommodation in the ordinary course
of the Senate day was essential to sanity."" Johnson, the most powerful Majority Leader in history, bent the Senate to his
will and forced it to become more efficient. He saw his colleagues as either ""whales""—the heavyweight chairmen who
negotiated legislation—or ""minnows,"" the followers who went along with the brokered deals. And when, in 1958, a
formidable new class of liberal Democrats entered the Senate—including Edmund Muskie, Eugene McCarthy, and Philip
Hart—the legislative machinery began to produce reform. Michael Janeway, the author of ""The Fall of the House of
Roosevelt,"" worked as a summer staff member between 1958 and 1962. ""They used to talk to each other—that's my most
vivid recollection,"" he said. ""If Wayne Morse talked of constitutional law on the floor, the Southerners would come in to
hear him. The same with Hubert Humphrey on farm policy. My strongest impression was of it being a deliberative body,
drawing each other out—sometimes pedantically."" Senators who ran for office in order to work on foreign policy, social
welfare, or urbanization had to win credibility with the whales. ""But if you wanted to do something there was a mechanism
by which you could do it,"" Janeway said.
In the sixties and seventies, Southern-conservative control was broken by a coalition of left-of-center Democrats and
moderate Republicans. Donald Ritchie, the Senate historian, who started working there in 1976, described the Senate of
those decades as ""a bipartisan liberal institution."" The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was written largely out of the office of the
Republican Minority Leader, Everett Dirksen. Every major initiative—voting rights, open ho"							
sing	 environmental law							
campaign reform—enjoyed bipartisan support. In the rare event of a filibuster	 the motion to end debate was often filed							
jointly by leaders of both parties. When Medicare—that government takeover of health care for the elderly—was passed								
in 1965	 it won 70-24.							
The Senate's momentum nurtured superb talent: William Fulbright	 Everett Dirksen	 Henry Jackson	 Frank Church					
Howard Baker. In 1969	 George McGovern chaired a select committee on hunger that actually held bipartisan ""field							
hearings"" in poor regions	 calling witnesses in migrant labor camps	 and then	 with Bob Dole's indispensable support					
greatly expanded the food-stamp program. The intensity of senatorial purpose in those years must strike today's								
legislators as profoundly humbling. After Joe Biden came to the Senate	 in 1973	 Hubert Humphrey took him aside and						
said	 ""You have to pick an issue that becomes yours. That's how you attract your colleagues to follow you	 Joe. That's						
how you demonstrate your bona fides. Don't be a gadfly."" Humphrey's career advice: ""You should become Mr. Housing.								
Housing is the future.""								
The Senate's modern decline began in 1978	 with the election of a new wave of anti-government conservatives	 and						
accelerated as Republicans became the majority in 1981. ""The Quayle generation came in	 and there were a number of							
people just like Dan—same generation	 same hair style	 same beliefs	 Gary Hart	 the Colorado Democrat	 recalled. ""They			
were harder-line. They weren't there to get along with Democrats. But they look accommodationist compared to								
Republicans in the Senate today."" Church	 McGovern	 Javits	 and Birch Bayh were gone. Ira Shapiro	 the former aide				
who is writing a book about the Senate of the sixties and seventies	 said	 ""It was a huge loss of the most experienced						
accomplished senators being replaced by neophytes. All of a sudden	 in 1981	 more than half the Senate had been there						
less than six years."" He added	 ""The shattering of the great Senate has long-term effects that keep showing up. It gets							
worse over time	 but it just never gets restored. There was a phrase I heard from Helms and the younger ones: 'Others							
didn't want to make waves; I wanted to drain the swamp.'""								
After C-SPAN went on the air	 in 1979	 the cozy atmosphere that encouraged both deliberation and back-room deals						
began to yield to transparency and	 with it	 posturing. ""So Damn Much Money	 a recent book by the Washington Post					
reporter Robert G. Kaiser	 traces the spectacular rise of Washington lobbying to the same period. Liberal Republicans							
began to disappear	 and as Southern Democrats died out they were replaced by conservative Republicans. Bipartisan							
coalitions on both wings of the Senate vanished. The institutionalist gave way to the free agent	 who controlled his own							
fund-raising apparatus and media presence	 and whose electoral base was a patchwork of single-issue groups. Members							
of both parties—Howard Metzenbaum	 the Ohio Democrat; Jesse Helms	 the North Carolina Republican—took to						
regularly using the Senate's rules to tie up business for narrowly ideological reasons. The number of filibusters shot up in								
the eighties and continued to rise in the following decades	 as the parties kept alternating control of the Senate and							
escalating a procedural arms race	 routinely blocking the confirmation of executive and judicial appointees. Democrats							
filibustered Republican nominees to the bench; then Republicans threatened to ban the filibuster in such cases—the so-								
called ""nuclear option."" Older members were perturbed when	 in 2004	 the Republican Majority Leader	 Bill Frist	 went to

South Dakota to campaign against the Democratic Minority Leader	 Tom Daschle (who went on to lose). A few years							
earlier	 such an action would have been unthinkable.							
The weakened institution could no longer withstand pressures from outside its walls; as money and cameras rushed in								
independent minds fell more and more in line with the partisans. Rough parity between the two parties meant that every								
election had the potential to make or break a majority	 crushing the incentive to cooperate across the aisle. The Senate							
no longer a fount of ideas	 became a backwater of the U.S. government. During the Clinton years	 the main action was						
between the White House and the Gingrich House of Representatives; during the Bush years	 the Republican Senate							
majority abdicated the oversight role that could have placed a vital check on executive power.								
Norman Ornstein	 a congressional expert at the American Enterprise Institute	 said that the Senate has increasingly						
become populated by ""ideologues and charlatans."" He went on	 ""When we do get good people who come in	 they very						
quickly get ground up by the dynamic and the culture of the parties. And once you get there	 look at what it takes to stay							
there."" He spoke of Charles Grassley	 the Iowa Republican	 who	 nearing the end of his career	 spent much of last year				
working closely with his friend Max Baucus on the health-care bill. Then	 in August	 Grassley went home and	 faced with					
angry Republican voters and the prospect of a primary challenge from the right	 started warning about ""pulling the plug on							
Grandma."" Ornstein added that similar pressures had led John McCain to begin ""altering his behavior and abandoning								
every issue	 including campaign-finance reform.""							
One morning in April	 I visited Harry McPherson	 the former L.B.J. aide	 at the offices of the legal and lobbying firm D. L.					
A. Piper	 in downtown Washington. McPherson	 who is eighty	 had on his desk the firm's spiral-bound directory for the					
111th Congress. I asked him who	 in Johnsonian terms	 were the whales of the current Senate. McPherson ran his finger						
down the list of senators. He did it again. ""I'm trying here	 looking for a remote descendant. Judas Priest	 look at this."" He						
was stumped. ""Well	 I see some good people	 I see some people who are going to get coalitions together over time."" He						
put the directory aside. ""I'm just having the damnedest time.""								
Down the hall from McPherson's office was that of Mel Martinez	 a former Republican senator from Florida; he was hired							
last year	 two weeks after resigning his Senate seat without completing his first term. (He has since moved on to							
JPMorgan Chase.) William Cohen	 the former Maine senator and Secretary of Defense	 has an office downstairs. Tom						
Daschle works at D. L. A. Piper; his predecessor as Democratic leader	 George Mitchell	 was the firm's chairman	 until					
President Obama appointed him to be his Middle East envoy. One feature of the diminished U.S. senator is the ease with								
which he moves from legislating to lobbying. Between 1998 and 2004	 half the senators who left office became lobbyists.							
In 2007	 Trent Lott	 a Republican leader in the Senate less than a year into his fourth term	 abruptly resigned and formed					
a lobbying firm with former Senator John Breaux	 just a few weeks before a new law took effect requiring a two-year							
waiting period between serving and lobbying.								
When you spend your days at the Senate	 it's easy to forget about everything else. The House of Representatives seems							
miles away (it's just down a corridor and across the rotunda)	 the White House is another country	 and actual foreign						
countries are unimaginable. The place remains insular	 labyrinthine	 and opaque—even physically. Senators commute						
thirty seconds between their offices and the chamber by electric subway cars that run along a tunnel under Constitution								
Avenue. Many signs are misleading or obsolete (the gilded lettering over the visitors' gallery says ""Men's Gallery"")	 and							
the Capitol is filled with secret passageways and spare rooms	 called hideaways	 doled out according to seniority	 where					
senators can read	 drink	 doze	 and wait for the buzzer announcing an imminent vote. The most pervasive authority over					
the institution is not the Constitution or the Bible but	 rather	 an impenetrable sixteen-hundred-page tome	 by Floyd M.					
Riddick	 called ""Senate Procedure: Precedents and Practices	 which only the late Robert Byrd	 of West Virginia	 was				
known to have read in its entirety. The procedures are so abstruse that a parliamentarian must sit below the presiding								
officer and	 essentially	 tell him or her what to say.						
After half a century	 the picture given by Preminger's ""Advise and Consent"" is still faintly visible. ""The Senate	 by its						
nature	 is a place where consensus reigns and personal relationships are paramount	 Lamar Alexander said. ""And that's						
not changed."" Which is exactly the problem: it's a self-governing body that depends on the reasonableness of its								
members to function. Sarah Binder	 a congressional scholar at George Washington University	 said	 ""To have a chamber					
that rules by unanimous consent—it's nutty! Especially when you've got Jim Bunning to please.""								
In 2006 and 2008	 sixteen Democrats entered the Senate	 giving the Party its current majority of fifty-nine to forty-one						
(counting two independents). They include moderates	 like Jon Tester	 of Montana	 and Mark Warner	 of Virginia; liberals				
like Sherrod Brown	 of Ohio	 and Sheldon Whitehouse	 of Rhode Island; policy specialists	 like Amy Klobuchar	 of			
Minnesota	 and Jeff Merkley; and iconoclasts	 like Claire McCaskill. Their interest in legislating has won the admiration of						
senior senators. ""If they can stay	 I think they'll be terrific	 Chris Dodd said. ""My worry is they won't stay. Because it's not						
productive.""								
The Democratic class of 2008 arrived with President Obama	 expecting to usher in 6 dynamic new era. Instead	 their						
young Senate careers have passed in a daily slog of threatened filibusters and ""secret holds""—when a senator								
anonymously objects to bringing an appointment up for a vote	 which requires unanimous consent. On April 20th	 Claire						
McCaskill took the trouble to read off the names of fifty-six Obama nominees languishing in the limbo of secret holds	 and							
Jon Kyl objected to every one of them. Just getting a bill to the floor for debate can require days of tactical gamesmanship								
between the party leaders. There were times when Warner wondered if anyone had ever quit in the first year. Michael								
Bennet said	 ""We find ourselves at a moment in our history when the questions are huge ones	 not small ones	 and where					
things have been put off for a really long period of time."" He mentioned the national debt	 energy policy	 and the financial						
crisis. ""Yet you have a Senate that's designed not to advance change but to slow it.""

We were talking in his hideaway	 a windowless room in the Capitol basement	 which had a mini-fridge stocked with bottled						
water	 black leatherette furniture circa 1962	 and a TV tuned to C-SPAN2 on mute; Senator Kyl's mouth was moving.						
Bennet	 the former superintendent of schools in Denver	 was appointed to a vacant seat in 2009	 and already has to					
defend it this year. He described the Senate with the dry bluntness of an outsider who hasn't allowed himself to grow too								
attached. Bennet repeated a story he had heard. about a new congressman giving his maiden speech: ""And then some								
more veteran guy came over and said	 'Son	 you're talking like this place is on the level. It's not on the level.' As the fifteen						
months or so have gone by that I've been here	 the less on the level it seems.""							
Earlier this year	 the Senate's procedural absurdities became national news twice in one month. On February 4th							
Con gressDaily reported that Richard Shelby	 an Alabama Republican	 was secretly blocking the confirmation of seventy						
Obama appointees over a dispute involving defense earmarks for his•state. (His tactics exposed	 Shelby—whose office							
maintains that he was responsible for fewer than fifty holds—lifted all but three.) Later that month	 Bunning spent several							
days and a late night on the Senate floor	 filibustering to prevent benefits from being paid to millions of unemployed							
Americans. When Merkley tried to reason with him	 Bunning responded	 ""Tough shit."" (Eventually	 Republicans persuaded					
Bunning to stop.)								
These incidents elicited a brief outcry	 but the extent of the Senate's routine folly remains largely hidden. For example							
Grassley and Ron Wyden	 of Oregon	 have been trying since 1997 to end the practice of secret holds	 without success. In					
2007	 the Senate passed a bill banning secret holds that last longer than six days. But to get around the ban two or more							
senators can pass the hold back and forth—it's called ""rolling holds""—and their party leader facilitates the game by								
keeping their names secret.								
Many of the Senate's antique rules and precedents have been warped beyond recognition by the modern pressures of								
partisanship. The hold	 for example	 was a courtesy extended to senators in the days of horse travel	 when they needed					
time to get back to Washington and read a bill or question an appointee before casting their vote. Sarah Binder	 who co-							
authored a book on the filibuster	 calls the procedure a historical accident: in 1806	 the Senate got rid of a little-used rule						
that allowed the ""previous question"" to be called to a vote. Suddenly	 there was no inherent limit on debate	 and by the						
eighteen-thirties senators had begun taking advantage of this loophole	 derailing the proceedings by getting up and talking							
until their voice	 legs	 or bladder gave out. (The word ""filibuster' comes from vrijbuiter—old Dutch for ""looter."")						
In 1917	 Woodrow Wilson	 with his wartime legislative agenda blocked by filibusters	 forced the Senate to pass Rule XXII					
which allowed a two-thirds majority to bring a floor debate to an end with a ""cloture"" vote. For decades	 the rule was rarely							
used; between 1919 and 1971	 there were only forty-nine cloture votes	 fewer than one per year. In the seventies and						
eighties	 the annual average rose to about a dozen. (Frustration with this increase led the Senate	 in 1975	 to lower the					
threshold for cloture to sixty votes.) In the nineties and early aughts	 the average went up to twenty-five or thirty a year	 as						
both parties escalated their use of the filibuster when they found themselves in the minority. After the Republicans lost								
their majority in 2006	 filibusters became everyday events: there were a hundred and twelve cloture votes in 2007 and							
2008	 and this session Republicans are on target to break their own filibuster record.							
The tally of cloture votes reflects only a small fraction of senatorial obstruction. Three hundred and forty-five bills passed								
by the House have been prevented from even coming up for debate in the Senate. ""Why?"" Steny Hoyer	 the outraged							
Democratic Majority Leader of the House	 asked me. ""Because they do not do their business in a way that facilitates							
noncontroversial things. Thankfully	 the House of Representatives is not becoming the Senate."" Last week	 six House						
Democrats expressed their displeasure with the upper chamber by staging a sit-in of sorts on the Senate floor.								
Seventy-six nominees for judgeships and executive posts have been approved by committees but	 because of blocks							
haven't come up for a vote in the full Senate	 leaving courtrooms idle and jobs unfilled across the upper levels of the							
Obama Administration. (The Democrats also practiced the art of blocking nominees during the Bush Administration.)								
There's often no objection to the individual being blocked: after an eight-month hold	 Martha Johnson	 nominated to run						
the General Services Administration	 was confirmed 96-0. On an issue like health-care reform	 when the objection was						
substantive	 Republicans ransacked Riddick's ""Senate Procedure"" for every conceivable way to delay a debate and vote.							
Judd Gregg even sent a memo on stalling tactics to his Republican colleagues. Tom Coburn demanded the reading aloud								
of an entire seven-hundred-and-sixty-seven-page amendment proposed by Bernie Sanders	 the Vermont socialist; Senate							
clerks	 working in half-hour shifts	 were three hours into the chore when Sanders withdrew the amendment in frustration.						
Under McConnell	 Republicans have consistently consumed as much of the Senate's calendar as possible with legislative							
maneuvering. The strategy is not to extend deliberation of the Senate's agenda but to prevent it. Tom Harkin	 who first							
proposed reform of the filibuster in 1995	 called his Republican colleagues ""nihilists	 who want to create chaos because it						
serves their ideology. ""If there's chaos	 things will tend toward simple solutions	 Harkin said. ""In chaos people don't listen						
to reason."" McConnell did not respond to requests for an interview	 but he has often argued that the Republican strategy							
reflects the views of a majority of Americans. In March	 he told the Times	 ""To the extent that they""—the Democrats—						
want to do things that we think are in the political center and would be helpful to the country	 we'll be helpful. To the							
extent they are trying to turn us into a Western European country	 we are not going to be helpful.""							
One of the mysteries of the Senate is how Mitch McConnell has been able to keep his members in line	 on vote after vote.							
Why do moderates with years of experience and their own power base back home—Richard Lugar	 of Indiana; Susan							
Collins	 of Maine; George Voinovich	 of Ohio—keep siding with the more extreme members of their caucus? Alexander						
said that McConnell listens well to all his members	 adding	 ""When you have your back against the wall and the gallows						
are hanging in front of you	 it tends to unify. Operating with forty members—it concentrates the mind.""

Lindsey Graham described to the Times how McConnell exhorted his caucus after the disastrous 2008 election: ""He said								
if we didn't stick together on big things	 we wouldn't be relevant."" Last December	 the Republicans decided to filibuster a						
military-spending bill in order to delay the looming vote on health care until as close to Christmas as possible. Thad								
Cochran	 the Republican ranking member of the Appropriations Committee	 promised Daniel Inouye	 the chairman	 that				
he wouldn't join the effort. But at the last minute Cochran	 who has been in the Senate since 1979 and brings							
disproportionate amounts of defense money to Mississippi	 told Reid that his leadership wouldn't allow him to vote with							
the Democrats and end the filibuster—even on a matter of national security. (The Democrats were able to impose cloture								
and the vote on health care finally took place on Christmas Eve.)								
Republican defections have been rare. In early 2009	 Collins and Olympia Snowe	 also of Maine	 voted for the stimulus					
bill	 along with Arlen Specter (who promptly switched parties). Snowe also voted for the Finance Committee's health-care-							
reform bill last October	 the only Republican to do so. But in December	 at the pivotal moment	 she voted against the					
version that went before the full Senate. ""I wasn't interested in expanding this program beyond the Finance Committee								
version—it grew by a thousand pages	 Snowe said. She wasn't included in the negotiations with White House officials							
that took place in an elegant conference room across from Reid's suite of offices	 and said that the Democrats ""did not							
accept any of my proposals. As I said to the President	 it was all windup and no pitch."" McConnell was able to exploit her							
alienation. A friend of Snowe cited another reason for her reversal: ""She actually said to me once that she had never felt								
the pressure that she felt on health care	 never before had that pressure been quite as evident to her or quite as real or							
troubling. Kyl and McConnell were saying things like 'You just can't let us down	 we're all in this together. You're a senior							
Republican member of this caucus	 and you just have to hang tough with us. We expect it and you're going to do it.' ""							
Reid doesn't use such tough tactics; he has achieved his position	 in spite of his public shortcomings	 by being the senator						
who helped other Democrats	 always answered their calls	 and got them what they wanted through masterly						
maneuvering. This has made him enormously popular within the Democratic caucus	 but it doesn't give him the leverage							
of McConnell	 let alone of Lyndon Johnson.							
In the current Senate	 it has become normal for a handful of senators	 sometimes representing just ten or twenty per cent						
of the country's population	 to hold everything up. And the status quo has become sufficiently frustrating that a few new							
senators have considered a radical option: mutiny.								
Tom Udall	 who is sixty-two	 is older than most freshman senators. He has the crow's-feet of a Westerner who has spent						
time in the sun	 and a slow	 good-natured voice. His father	 Stewart	 was an Arizona congressman and the Interior				
Secretary for Presidents Kennedy and Johnson; his uncle Mo was a legendary Arizona representative; his cousin Mark is								
a freshman senator from Colorado. Udall served five terms in the House before winning a Senate seat from New Mexico								
in 2008. And yet he has the air of a political Candide—he is always earnest	 capable of disappointment but not cynicism.							
I ran on the idea that the Senate should not be a graveyard for good ideas	 he said. ""Then to be on the inside—the thing							
that strikes you is how one senator can hold up the whole show.""								
In his first year in office	 Udall decided to do something audacious: he would try to change the Senate's rules.							
Customarily	 the rules continue session after session	 and a provision in Rule XXII requires sixty-seven votes to amend						
them	 making it extremely difficult. (""Rule XXII is a Catch-22	 Ted Kennedy used to joke.) Udall embraced a different						
idea—the ""constitutional option."" Article I	 Section 5 of the Constitution states that ""each House may determine the Rules							
of its Proceedings"" at the beginning of the new Congress. So	 in theory	 a senator could take the floor next January and						
propose debating its rules from scratch	 including the filibuster. New rules could be passed with a simple majority. There's							
even a precedent for this: moves to revisit the rules by invoking the constitutional option have been made three times								
most recently in 1975. Udall has spent much of the past year trying to build support for the idea.								
At the request of Udall and others	 Schumer	 who is the chairman of the Rules Committee	 has held a series of hearings					
on the filibuster	 calling witnesses such as Sarah Binder	 the historian	 and Walter Mondale	 who was in the Senate when				
the constitutional option was invoked in 1975. Dick Durbin	 the second-highest-ranking Democrat	 has organized working						
groups among newer members on other internal reforms	 such as ending secret holds and choosing committee chairs by							
caucus vote rather than by seniority. (Lamar Alexander wryly suggested to me that Schumer and Durbin were competing								
for the favor of newer members	 in case Harry Reid loses his seat in the fall and they run against each other for Majority							
Leader.)								
For Republican institutionalists	 such as Alexander and Gregg	 the push for rules reform is folly. ""If you want a						
parliamentary form of government	 go over to the House	 Gregg	 who is about to retire	 scoffed. ""Why even run for the				
Senate?"" Udall's plan for next January	 he said	 would be a ""gigantic mistake.""						
They'll get over it	 Alexander said of the Democrats' enthusiasm for rules reform. ""And they'll get over it quicker if they're							
in the minority next January. Because they'll instantly see the value of slowing the Senate down to consider whatever they								
have to say."" He added that the Senate ""may be getting done about as much as the American people want done."" The								
President's ambitious agenda	 after all	 has upset a lot of voters	 across the political spectrum. None of the Republicans I					
spoke to agreed with the contention that the Senate is ""broken."" Alexander claimed that he and other Republicans were								
exercising the moderating	 thoughtful influence on legislation that the founders wanted in the Senate. ""The Senate wasn't							
created to be efficient	 he argued. ""It was created to be inefficient."" At one of the filibuster hearings	 in April	 Alexander					
sitting across the table from Udall	 said that	 for all the times the Democrats charge the Republicans with obstructing						
legislation	 ""we could say that's the number of times the majority has tried to cut off our right to debate	 our right to offer						
amendments	 which is the essence of the Senate.""

Newcomers like Udall seem to think that the Senate has grown so absurd and extreme that some kind of reform is								
inevitable. Perhaps they need more time to plumb the depths of the institution's intransigence. According to Sarah Binder								
a change in rules is extremely unlikely; Republicans would be implacably opposed to	 say	 weakening the filibuster	 and					
so would some Democrats	 especially long-serving ones. ""I would oppose that	 Chris Dodd said	 adding of the freshmen					
These are people who have never been in the minority."" For older Democrats	 who have put in their years	 grown adept						
at working the rules	 and now chair powerful committees	 the reform impulse could be a threat. (Among senior senators						
the sole enthusiast for rules reform is Tom Harkin.) One senator spoke of the Senate as being divided not between								
whales and minnows but	 rather	 between bulls and calves. The older Democrats are too accustomed to the Senate's						
ways to share the frustrations of the newcomers; the handful of older moderate Republicans are too weak to challenge the								
newer radicals who now dominate the caucus.								
Even if the freshmen Democrats can somehow reform the filibuster next January	 the Senate will remain a sclerotic							
wasteful	 unhappy body. The deepest source of its problems is not rules and precedents but	 rather	 its human beings					
who have created a culture where Tocqueville's ""lofty thoughts"" and ""generous impulses"" have no place.								
A few days after passing health-care reform	 the Senate struggled to its feet to take on a second large task. Financial							
regulatory reform should have been the easiest piece of major legislation of the Obama Presidency	 the likeliest to win							
real bipartisan support. The financial crisis had been catastrophic for millions of Americans	 and after the 2008 bailout							
Wall Street had become even more hated than the Senate was. In April	 a lineup of bankers from Goldman Sachs							
appeared before Senator Levin's subcommittee on investigations	 and managed to appear as arrogant	 callous	 and					
evasive as their reputations had suggested. The public demanded action. Some Republicans had a genuine desire to								
pass a bill. If health-care reform had been a war of attrition	 financial reform was a promising liaison.							
The affair began with a Republican	 Bob Corker	 and a Democrat	 Mark Warner—both multimillionaires serving their first					
term	 both considered centrists. Corker is a small	 dapper former construction magnate who became the mayor of						
Chattanooga; Warner is a tall	 preppily dressed former telecommunications entrepreneur who became the governor of							
Virginia. Chris Dodd	 the Banking Committee chairman	 assigned them to work together on the section of the bill having to						
do with the liquidation of troubled firms—making sure that there would never be another taxpayer bailout. They worked								
through the winter	 in Warner's office	 in Corker's office	 over dinner	 sometimes without staff	 as if they were members of			
a Senate from the past. They hosted a series of afternoon seminars	 inviting guests such as Ben Bernanke	 Alan						
Greenspan	 and Sheila Bair. Corker and Warner were sometimes said to be the only Democrat and Republican still							
talking to each other. In January	 Business Week called them the Senate's ""Odd Couple."" By February	 they had finished						
their work.								
Meanwhile	 discussions about the entire bill between Dodd and Richard Shelby	 the top Republican on the committee						
dragged on	 repeatedly breaking down. Finally	 on February 10th	 Dodd called Corker	 who	 though he was one of the			
committee's junior members	 agreed to be the chairman's Republican negotiating partner. When Corker informed							
McConnell and Shelby	 they expressed surprise. ""It was an odd place to be	 Corker recalled. ""And yet that night we						
began meeting."" The junior Republican savored the rare experience of creating	 rather than opposing	 legislation. In						
response	 Shelby's conservative staff tried to undermine Corker	 spreading rumors among Republicans and their lobbyists						
that he was giving too much away. (A Shelby aide said that staff members were simply informing other Republicans of the								
Party's line on financial reform.)								
On March 10th	 Dodd concluded that he had to move a bill to the floor. He called Corker and said	 ""You've been a great						
partner."" He was ending their talks after only a month. ""It's a little stunning	 I've got to be honest	 Corker told reporters						
afterward. Someone close to the negotiations compared Corker to Dickens's Miss Havisham	 unable to get over the							
rebuff	 forever awaiting the arrival of her groom	 all her clocks stopped. Corker later said that Dodd had ended the talks						
under pressure from the White House and other Democrats. Dodd said that Corker had been unable to bring any other								
Republicans with him. ""Baloney	 Corker said. ""If Dodd had reached an agreement with me	 we'd've had at least twenty-						
five Republican votes.""								
The bill that Dodd brought before the Senate	 after a year of discussions with Democrats and Republicans alike							
incorporated the bipartisan plan of Warner and Corker to prevent another bank bailout: setting up a fifty-billion-dollar fund								
paid for by the banks	 to insure orderly liquidation	 and establishing a risk council to detect warning signs of another crisis.						
But in mid-April Mitch McConnell—who had just met with Wall Street executives in New York	 and was now parroting							
talking points from a memo written by the Republican strategist Frank Luntz—called it a ""partisan bill"" that ""will guarantee								
perpetual taxpayer bailout of Wall Street banks."" McConnell presented a letter	 signed by all forty-one Republicans							
suggesting that they would filibuster the financial-reform bill.								
His remarks amounted to a repudiation of Corker's work as well as of Dodd's. The next day	 April 15th	 Corker pleaded						
with his colleagues	 in his Tennessee twang	 ""Let's come to the floor and let's act like adults. Let's tone down the rhetoric.						
Let's don't exaggerate the pluses or minuses. Let's do what the Senate was created to do. . . . We were supposed to be								
the people that took some of the red-hot activities that sometimes come from the other body and sat down with cooler								
heads and resolved the issues like adults. We can do that. As a matter of fact	 I would say	 if we cannot do that on						
financial regulation	 an issue that really doesn't have any real philosophical bearings to it . . ."" Corker didn't allow the							
thought to ripen—he had already gone farther than almost any Republican would have dared.								
Dodd spoke later in the day and completed Corker's speech: ""I know my friends on the other side of the aisle are faced								
with a difficult choice between supporting their party leadership and participating in this complicated	 difficult debate. I am							
not naïve. I know that is a hard place to be. But if we can't act like U.S. senators for the sake of this issue . . . then why

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770192 Date: 08/31/2015								
are we even here?"" He went on	 ""We work for an American public that is sick and tired of feeling like no one is looking out							
for their interests	 like the political hacks and lobbyists hold all the cards in these discussions. The minority seems intent							
on proving them right. . . . I have been here a long time. I know this institution is better than that. I know there are friends								
of mine on the other side of the aisle who care about this bill	 who want to be a part of the debate	 who want to be part of						
the solution.""								
In the same speech	 Dodd joined the partisan fight	 accusing McConnell of lying about the bill. Turning crimson-faced	 he					
chopped the air with his hand as he shouted	 ""I have to ask myself	 why did I go through this process over the last four or						
five months	 agreeing to much of what they were offering	 and there is not a single political vote to show for it. . . . I have						
to say to the younger members	 the newer members coming along: be careful!""							
Corker	 having heard that Dodd was speaking	 returned to the chamber and asked to respond. ""You and I went a long						
way	 Corker told Dodd. ""Then we stopped. On March 10th it ended. I understand that	 look	 you were losing Democrats					
on your committee.""								
And I was not gaining Republicans	 Dodd replied.							
You had one	 and that is all you asked for when you started. I never said I could speak for anybody but myself. And I did							
not leave the table."" Corker urged Dodd to keep talking to Republicans—their differences could be sorted out in a few								
days.								
But this was not McConnell's agenda. Instead	 financial reform became a slightly more polite repeat of the health-care-							
reform brawl: the Republicans threatened filibusters	 the Democrats threatened all-nighters	 and thousands of lobbyists						
prowled the Capitol	 charging their Wall Street clients more than a billion dollars. On April 28th	 I was sitting in the ornate						
Reception Room with Jim Manley	 Reid's spokesman. On the other side of the wall	 there was the noise of furniture						
scraping across a tile floor. ""Those are cots being set up in the L.B.J. Room	 Manley said. ""Very little happens around							
here without a deadline."" The cots persuaded Republicans to allow the bill to move to the floor for debate. A few weeks								
later	 on May 20th	 yet another filibuster was defeated by yet another cloture motion	 and financial reform finally came to a					
vote. It passed	 59-39. Only four Republicans had joined the majority. Corker wasn't among them. He had even voted for							
an amendment	 offered by his Republican colleague Jeff Sessions	 of Alabama	 that would have scrapped Corker's work					
of many months with Warner.								
The idea of watching Bob Corker vote for the Sessions amendment!"" Dodd said afterward	 sitting in his red-curtained							
office	 under a print of Holbein's portrait of Thomas More. ""It's the Senate	 I guess."" McConnell's strategy of obstruction						
had once again come close to succeeding	 Dodd said	 but he knew that a ""shrinking number"" of Republicans were						
frustrated. The previous day	 Dodd had said to Susan Collins	 ""God	 I would have loved to have you as my ranking					
member on this."" Collins responded	 ""We could have had such a great time on this bill.""							
Warner	 who said that he believed in bipartisanship because ""the American people don't trust either political party enough							
to give them a blank check	 was astonished that so few Republicans voted for financial reform. ""There was zero							
substantive reason why this couldn't have been eighty votes	 he said. I asked him why Bob Corker had voted no on the							
bill. Warner started to talk about the consumer-protection title	 and then said	 ""If you want to vote against something	 you					
can always find your reasons.""								
But Corker hadn't seemed to want to vote against it. He had spent months trying to act like a U.S. senator	 alienating							
himself from his own party and then the other party	 and on the day of the vote he held the floor for the better part of thirty							
minutes	 as if he were still reluctant to let the effort go. ""I am obviously disappointed	 he said. ""I think I have spent as						
much time as any senator. . . on policy regarding our financial system. I think any bill—even this bill—has good things in								
it. There is no question. And I appreciate the thrust. But I think there is a lot of overreaching	 and I think not enough time							
was spent on some of the core issues.""								
As the senators cast their votes	 I noticed Robert Kaiser	 the author of ""So Damn Much Money	 in the press gallery. I later					
asked him if	 with the passage of two big reform bills in three months	 we were witnessing a possible renewal of the						
Senate. ""If you can engage public opinion in a way politicians can understand	 public opinion can still blow away money							
and interest groups	 he said. ""But over the past few decades the reflex has grown in the Senate that	 all things						
considered	 it's better to avoid than to take on big issues. This is the kind of thing that drives Michael Bennet nutty: here							
you've arrived in the United States Senate and you can't do fuck-all about the destruction of the planet.""								
After the final vote on financial reform	 the Republicans flew home	 and the Democratic leaders held a press conference						
smiling before the microphones outside the Senate chamber. Reid said	 ""For those who wanted to protect Wall Street	 it						
didn't work."" He then excused himself: he had to join Biden for a telephone fund-raiser with ""some Nevadans.""								
Durbin said	 ""I was stunned that only four Republicans would join us in passing this historic legislation. What does it take							
to bring the Republican Party into the conversation about the future of America?""								
Dodd	 glowing with triumph	 said	 ""I wanted to demonstrate that the Senate of the United States could conduct its					
business much as our founders intended. We did that.""								
On July 21st	 President Obama signed the completed bill. The two lasting achievements of this Senate	 financial						
regulation and health care	 required a year and a half of legislative warfare that nearly destroyed the body. They							
depended on a set of circumstances—a large majority of Democrats	 a charismatic President with an electoral mandate							
and a national crisis—that will not last long or be repeated anytime soon. Two days after financial reform became law								
Harry Reid announced that the Senate would not take up comprehensive energy-reform legislation for the rest of the year.								
And so climate change joined immigration	 job creation	 food safety	 pilot training	 veterans' care	 campaign finance			
transportation security	 labor law	 mine safety	 wildfire management	 and scores of executive and judicial appointments on

gic they may be	 McChrystal's new marching orders have caused an intense backlash among his own							
troops. Being told to hold their fire	 soldiers complain	 puts them in greater danger. ""Bottom line?"" says a former Special						
Forces operator who has spent years in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""I would love to kick McChrystal in the nuts. His rules of								
engagement put soldiers' lives in even greater danger. Every real soldier will tell you the same thing.""								
In March	 McChrystal traveled to Combat Outpost JFM — a small encampment on the outskirts of Kandahar — to confront							
such accusations from the troops directly. It was a typically bold move by the general. Only two days earlier	 he had							
received an e-mail from Israel Arroyo	 a 25-year-old staff sergeant who asked McChrystal to go on a mission with his unit.							
I am writing because it was said you don't care about the troops and have made it harder to defend ourselves	 Arroyo							
wrote.								
Within hours	 McChrystal responded personally: ""I'm saddened by the accusation that I don't care about soldiers	 as it is						
something I suspect any soldier takes both personally and professionally — at least I do. But I know perceptions depend								
upon your perspective at the time	 and I respect that every soldier's view is his own."" Then he showed up at Arroyo's							
outpost and went on a foot patrol with the troops — not some bullshit photo-op stroll through a market	 but a real live							
operation in a dangerous war zone.								
Six weeks later	 just before McChrystal returned from Paris	 the general received another e-mail from Arroyo. A 23-year-						
old corporal named Michael Ingram — one of the soldiers McChrystal had gone on patrol with — had been killed by an IED								
a day earlier. It was the third man the 25-member platoon had lost in a year	 and Arroyo was writing to see if the general							
would attend Ingram's memorial service. ""He started to look up to you	 Arroyo wrote. McChrystal said he would try to							
make it down to pay his respects as soon as possible.								
The night before the general is scheduled to visit Sgt. Arroyo's platoon for the memorial	 I arrive at Combat Outpost JFM							
to speak with the soldiers he had gone on patrol with. JFM is a small encampment	 ringed by high blast walls and guard							
towers. Almost all of the soldiers here have been on repeated combat tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan	 and have seen							
some of the worst fighting of both wars. But they are especially angered by Ingram's death. His commanders had								
repeatedly requested permission to tear down the house where Ingram was killed	 noting that it was often used as a							
combat position by the Taliban. But due to McChrystal's new restrictions to avoid upsetting civilians	 the request had been							
denied. ""These were abandoned houses	 fumes Staff Sgt. Kennith Hicks. ""Nobody was coming back to live in them.""							
One soldier shows me the list of new regulations the platoon was given. ""Patrol only in areas that you are reasonably								
certain that you will not have to defend yourselves with lethal force	 the laminated card reads. For a soldier who has							
traveled halfway around the world to fight	 that's like telling a cop he should only patrol in areas where he knows he won't							
have to make arrests. ""Does that make any fucking sense?"" asks Pfc. Jared Pautsch. ""We should just drop a fucking								
bomb on this place. You sit and ask yourself: What are we doing here?""								
The rules handed out here are not what McChrystal intended — they've been distorted as they passed through the chain of								
command — but knowing that does nothing to lessen the anger of troops on the ground. ""Fuck	 when I came over here and							
heard that McChrystal was in charge	 I thought we would get our fucking gun on	 says Hicks	 who has served three tours					
of combat. ""I get COIN. I get all that. McChrystal comes here	 explains it	 it makes sense. But then he goes away on his						
bird	 and by the time his directives get passed down to us through Big Army	 they're all fucked up — either because						
somebody is trying to cover their ass	 or because they just don't understand it themselves. But we're fucking losing this							
thing.""								
McChrystal and his team show up the next day. Underneath a tent	 the general has a 45-minute discussion with some two							
dozen soldiers. The atmosphere is tense. ""I ask you what's going on in your world	 and I think it's important for you all to							
understand the big picture as well	 McChrystal begins. ""How's the company doing? You guys feeling sorry for							
yourselves? Anybody? Anybody feel like you're losing?"" McChrystal says.								
Sir	 some of the guys here	 sir	 think we're losing	 sir	 says Hicks.			
McChrystal nods. ""Strength is leading when you just don't want to lead	 he tells the men. ""You're leading by example.							
That's what we do. Particularly when it's really	 really hard	 and it hurts inside."" Then he spends 20 minutes talking about						
counterinsurgency	 diagramming his concepts and principles on a whiteboard. He makes COIN seem like common sense							
but he's careful not to bullshit the men. ""We are knee-deep in the decisive year	 he tells them. The Taliban	 he insists	 no					
longer has the initiative — ""but I don't think we do	 either."" It's similar to the talk he gave in Paris	 but it's not winning any						
hearts and minds among the soldiers. ""This is the philosophical part that works with think tanks	 McChrystal tries to joke.							
But it doesn't get the same reception from infantry companies.""								
During the question-and-answer period	 the frustration boils over. The soldiers complain about not being allowed to use							
lethal force	 about watching insurgents they detain be freed for lack of evidence. They want to be able to fight — like they							
did in Iraq	 like they had in Afghanistan before McChrystal. 'We aren't putting fear into the Taliban	 one soldier says.						
Winning hearts and minds in COIN is a coldblooded thing	 McChrystal says	 citing an oft-repeated maxim that you can't						
kill your way out of Afghanistan. ""The Russians killed 1 million Afghans	 and that didn't work.""							
I'm not saying go out and kill everybody	 sir	 the soldier persists. ""You say we've stopped the momentum of the						
insurgency. I don't believe that's true in this area. The more we pull back	 the more we restrain ourselves	 the stronger it's						
getting.""								
I agree with you	 McChrystal says. ""In this area	 we've not made progress	 probably. You have to show strength here					
you have to use fire. What I'm telling you is	 fire costs you. What do you want to do? You want to wipe the population out							
here and resettle it?""								
A soldier complains that under the rules	 any insurgent who doesn't have a weapon is immediately assumed to be a							
civilian. ""That's the way this game is	 McChrystal says. ""It's complex. I can't just decide: It's shirts and skins	 and we'll kill						
all the shirts.""								
As the discussion ends	 McChrystal seems to sense that he hasn't succeeded at easing the men's anger. He makes one							
last-ditch effort to reach them	 acknowledging the death of Cpl. Ingram. ""There's no way I can make that easier	 he tells						
them. ""No way I can pretend it won't hurt. No way I can tell you not to feel that. . . . I will tell you	 you're doing a great job.							
Don't let the frustration get to you."" The session ends with no clapping	 and no real resolution. McChrystal may have sold							
President Obama on counterinsurgency	 but many of his own men aren't buying it.							
When it comes to Afghanistan	 history is not on McChrystal's side. The only foreign invader to have any success here							
was Genghis Khan — and he wasn't hampered by things like human rights	 economic development and press scrutiny.							
The COIN doctrine	 bizarrely	 draws inspiration from some of the biggest Western military embarrassments in recent						
memory: France's nasty war in Algeria (lost in 1962) and the American misadventure in Vietnam (lost in 1975).								
McChrystal	 like other advocates of COIN	 readily acknowledges that counterinsurgency campaigns are inherently messy						
expensive and easy to lose. ""Even Afghans are confused by Afghanistan	 he says. But even if he somehow manages to							
succeed	 after years of bloody fighting with Afghan kids who pose no threat to the U.S. homeland	 the war will do little to						
shut down Al Qaeda	 which has shifted its operations to Pakistan. Dispatching 150	000 troops to build new schools						
roads	 mosques and water-treatment facilities around Kandahar is like trying to stop the drug war in Mexico by occupying							
Arkansas and building Baptist churches in Little Rock. ""It's all very cynical	 politically	 says Marc Sageman	 a former CIA					
case officer who has extensive experience in the region. ""Afghanistan is not in our vital interest — there's nothing for us								
there.""								
In mid-May	 two weeks after visiting the troops in Kandahar	 McChrystal travels to the White House for a high-level visit by						
Hamid Karzai. It is a triumphant moment for the general	 one that demonstrates he is very much in command — both in							
Kabul and in Washington. In the East Room	 which is packed with journalists and dignitaries	 President Obama sings the						
praises of Karzai. The two leaders talk about how great their relationship is	 about the pain they feel over civilian							
casualties. They mention the word ""progress"" 16 times in under an hour. But there is no mention of victory. Still	 the •							
session represents the most forceful commitment that Obama has made to McChrystal's strategy in months. ""There is no								
denying the progress that the Afghan people have made in recent years — in education	 in health care and economic							
development	 the president says. ""As I saw in the lights across Kabul when I landed — lights that would not have been							
visible just a few years earlier.""								
It is a disconcerting observation for Obama to make. During the worst years in Iraq	 when the Bush administration had no							
real progress to point to	 officials used to offer up the exact same evidence of success. ""It was one of our first							
impressions	 one GOP official said in 2006	 after landing in Baghdad at the height of the sectarian violence. ""So many						
lights shining brightly."" So it is to the language of the Iraq War that the Obama administration has turned — talk of								
progress	 of city lights	 of metrics like health care and education. Rhetoric that just a few years ago they would have						
mocked. ""They are trying to manipulate perceptions because there is no definition of victory — because victory is not even								
defined or recognizable	 says Celeste Ward	 a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation who served as a political						
adviser to U.S. commanders in Iraq in 2006. ""That's the game we're in right now. What we need	 for strategic purposes	 is						
to create the perception that we didn't get run off. The facts on the ground are not great	 and are not going to become							
great in the near future.""								
But facts on the ground	 as history has proven	 offer little deterrent to a military determined to stay the course. Even those						
closest to McChrystal know that the rising anti-war sentiment at home doesn't begin to reflect how deeply fucked up things								
are in Afghanistan. ""If Americans pulled back and started paying attention to this war	 it would become even less popular							
a senior adviser to McChrystal says. Such realism	 however	 doesn't prevent advocates of counterinsurgency from						
dreaming big: Instead of beginning to withdraw troops next year	 as Obama promised	 the military hopes to ramp up its						
counterinsurgency campaign even further. ""There's a possibility we could ask for another surge of U.S. forces next								
summer if we see success here	 a senior military official in Kabul tells me.							
Back in Afghanistan	 less than a month after the White House meeting with Karzai and all the talk of ""progress							
McChrystal is hit by the biggest blow to his vision of counterinsurgency. Since last year	 the Pentagon had been planning							
to launch a major military operation this summer in Kandahar	 the country's second-largest city and the Taliban's original							
home base. It was supposed to be a decisive turning point in the war — the primary reason for the troop surge that								
McChrystal wrested from Obama late last year. But on June 10th	 acknowledging that the military still needs to lay more							
groundwork	 the general announced that he is postponing the offensive until the fall. Rather than one big battle	 like						
Fallujah or Ramadi	 U.S. troops will implement what McChrystal calls a ""rising tide of security."" The Afghan police and							
army will enter Kandahar to attempt to seize control of neighborhoods	 while the U.S. pours $90 million of aid into the city							
to win over the civilian population.								
Even proponents of counterinsurgency are hard-pressed to explain the new plan. ""This isn't a classic operation	 says a							
U.S. military official. ""It's not going to be Black Hawk Down. There aren't going to be doors kicked in."" Other U.S. officials								
insist that doors are going to be kicked in	 but that it's going to be a kinder	 gentler offensive than the disaster in Marja.						
The Taliban have a jackboot on the city	 says a military official. ""We have to remove them	 but we have to do it in a way						
that doesn't alienate the population."" When Vice President Biden was briefed on the new plan in the Oval Office	 insiders							
say he was shocked to see how much it mirrored the more gradual plan of counterterrorism that he advocated last fall.								
This looks like CT-plus!"" he said	 according to U.S. officials familiar with the meeting.							
Whatever the nature of the new plan	 the delay underscores the fundamental flaws of counterinsurgency. After nine years							
of war	 the Taliban simply remains too strongly entrenched for the U.S. military to openly attack. The very people that							
COIN seeks to win over — the Afghan people — do not want us there. Our supposed ally	 President Karzai	 used his						
influence to delay the offensive	 and the massive influx of aid championed by McChrystal is likely only to make things							
worse. ""Throwing money at the problem exacerbates the problem	 says Andrew Wilder	 an expert at Tufts University who						
has studied the effect of aid in southern Afghanistan. ""A tsunami of cash fuels corruption	 delegitimizes the government							
and creates an environment where we're picking winners and losers"" — a process that fuels resentment and hostility								
among the civilian population. So far	 counterinsurgency has succeeded only in creating a never-ending demand for the							
primary product supplied by the military: perpetual war. There is a reason that President Obama studiously avoids using								
the word ""victory"" when he talks about Afghanistan. Winning	 it would seem	 is not really possible. Not even with						
Stanley McChrystal in charge.

The Runaway General
Stanley McChrystal, Obama's top commander in Afghanistan,
has seized control of the war by never taking his eye off the
real enemy: The wimps in the White House
By Michael Hastings
Jun 22, 2010 10:00 AM EDT
This article originally appeared in RS 1108/1109 from July 8-22, 2010.
'Howed I get screwed into going to this dinner?"" demands Gen. Stanley McChrystal. It's a Thursday night in mid-April,
and the commander of all U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan is sitting in a four-star suite at the HOtel Westminster in
Paris. He's in France to sell his new war strategy to our NATO allies — to keep up the fiction, in essence, that we actually
have allies. Since McChrystal took over a year ago, the Afghan war has become the exclusive property of the United
States. Opposition to the war has already toppled the Dutch government, forced the resignation of Germany's president
and sparked both Canada and the Netherlands to announce the withdrawal of their 4,500 troops. McChrystal is in Paris to
keep the French, who have lost more than 40 soldiers in Afghanistan, from going all wobbly on him.
""The dinner comes with the position, sir,"" says his chief of staff, Col. Charlie Flynn.
McChrystal turns sharply in his chair.
""Hey, Charlie,"" he asks, ""does this come with the position?""
McChrystal gives him the middle finger.
The general stands and looks around the suite that his traveling staff of 10 has converted into a full-scale operations
center. The tables are crowded with silver Panasonic Toughbooks, and blue cables crisscross the hotel's thick carpet,
hooked up to satellite dishes to provide encrypted phone and e-mail communications. Dressed in off-the-rack civilian
casual — blue tie, button-down shirt, dress slacks — McChrystal is way out of his comfort zone. Paris, as one of his
advisers says, is the ""most anti-McChrystal city you can imagine."" The general hates fancy restaurants, rejecting any
place with candles on the tables as too ""Gucci."" He prefers Bud Light Lime (his favorite beer) to Bordeaux, Talladega
Nights (his favorite movie) to Jean-Luc Godard. Besides, the public eye has never been a place where McChrystal felt
comfortable: Before President Obama put him in charge of the war in Afghanistan, he spent five years running the
Pentagon's most secretive black ops.
""What's the update on the Kandahar bombing?"" McChrystal asks Flynn. The city has been rocked by two massive car
bombs in the past day alone, calling into question the general's assurances that he can wrest it from the Taliban.
""We have two KIAs, but that hasn't been confirmed,"" Flynn says.
McChrystal takes a final look around the suite. At 55, he is gaunt and lean, not unlike an older version of Christian Bale in
Rescue Dawn. His slate-blue eyes have the unsettling ability to drill down when they lock on you. If you've fucked up or
disappointed him, they can destroy your soul without the need for him to raise his voice.
""I'd rather have my ass kicked by a roomful of people than go out to this dinner,"" McChrystal says.
He pauses a beat.
""Unfortunately,"" he adds, ""no one in this room could do it.""
With that, he's out the door.
""Who's he going to dinner with?"" I ask one of his aides.
""Some French minister,"" the aide tells me. ""It's fucking gay.""

The next morning, McChrystal and his team gather to prepare for a speech he is giving at the Ecole Militaire, a French
military academy. The general prides himself on being sharper and ballsier than anyone else, but his brashness comes
with a price: Although McChrystal has been in charge of the war for only a year, in that short time he has managed to piss
off almost everyone with a stake in the conflict. Last fall, during the question-and-answer session following a speech he
gave in London, McChrystal dismissed the counterterrorism strategy being advocated by Vice President Joe Biden as
""shortsighted,"" saying it would lead to a state of ""Chaos-istan."" The remarks earned him a smackdown from the president
himself, who summoned the general to a terse private meeting aboard Air Force One. The message to McChrystal
seemed clear: Shut the fuck up, and keep a lower profile
Now, flipping through printout cards of his speech in Paris, McChrystal wonders aloud what Biden question he might get
today, and how he should respond. ""I never know what's going to pop out until I'm up there, that's the problem,"" he says.
Then, unable to help themselves, he and his staff imagine the general dismissing the vice president with a good one-
liner.
""Are you asking about Vice President Biden?"" McChrystal says with a laugh. ""Who's that?""
""Biden?"" suggests a top adviser. ""Did you say: Bite Me?""
When Barack Obama entered the Oval Office, he immediately set out to deliver on his most important campaign
promise on foreign policy: to refocus the war in Afghanistan on what led us to invade in the first place. ""I want the
American people to understand,"" he announced in March 2009. ""We have a clear and focused goal: to disrupt, dismantle
and defeat Al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan."" He ordered another 21,000 troops to Kabul, the largest increase since
the war began in 2001. Taking the advice of both the Pentagon and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he also fired Gen. David
McKiernan — then the U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan — and replaced him with a man he didn't know and had
met only briefly: Gen. Stanley McChrystal. It was the first time a top general had been relieved from duty during wartime in
more than 50 years, since Harry Truman fired Gen. Douglas MacArthur at the height of the Korean War.
Even though he had voted for Obama, McChrystal and his new commander in chief failed from the outset to connect. The
general first encountered Obama a week after he took office, when the president met with a dozen senior military officials
in a room at the Pentagon known as the Tank. According to sources familiar with the meeting, McChrystal thought Obama
looked ""uncomfortable and intimidated"" by the roomful of military brass. Their first one-on-one meeting took place in the
Oval Office four months later, after McChrystal got the Afghanistan job, and it didn't go much better. ""It was a 10-minute
photo op,"" says an adviser to McChrystal. ""Obama clearly didn't know anything about him, who he was. Here's the guy
who's going to run his fucking war, but he didn't seem very engaged. The Boss was pretty disappointed.""
From the start, McChrystal was determined to place his personal stamp on Afghanistan, to use it as a laboratory for a
controversial military strategy known as counterinsurgency. COIN, as the theory is known, is the new gospel of the
Pentagon brass, a doctrine that attempts to square the military's preference for high-tech violence with the demands of
fighting protracted wars in failed states. COIN calls for sending huge numbers of ground troops to not only destroy the
enemy, but to live among the civilian population and slowly rebuild, or build from scratch, another nation's government — a
process that even its staunchest advocates admit requires years, if not decades, to achieve. The theory essentially
rebrands the military, expanding its authority (and its funding) to encompass the diplomatic and political sides of warfare:
Think the Green Berets as an armed Peace Corps. In 2006, after Gen. David Petraeus beta-tested the theory during his
""surge"" in Iraq, it quickly gained a hardcore following of think-tankers, journalists, military officers and civilian officials.
Nicknamed ""COINdinistas"" for their cultish zeal, this influential cadre believed the doctrine would be the perfect solution
for Afghanistan. All they needed was a general with enough charisma and political savvy to implement it.
As McChrystal leaned on Obama to ramp up the war, he did it with the same fearlessness he used to track down terrorists
in Iraq: Figure out how your enemy operates, be faster and more ruthless than everybody else, then take the fuckers out.
After arriving in Afghanistan last June, the general conducted his own policy review, ordered up by Defense Secretary
Robert Gates. The now-infamous report was leaked to the press, and its conclusion was dire: If we didn't send another
40,000 troops — swelling the number of U.S. forces in Afghanistan by nearly half — we were in danger of ""mission failure.""
The White House was furious. McChrystal, they felt, was trying to bully Obama, opening him up to charges of being weak
on national security unless he did what the general wanted. It was Obama versus the Pentagon, and the Pentagon was
determined to kick the president's ass.
Last fall, with his top general calling for more troops, Obama launched a three-month review to re-evaluate the strategy in
Afghanistan. ""I found that time painful,"" McChrystal tells me in one of several lengthy interviews. ""I was selling an
unsellable position."" For the general, it was a crash course in Beltway politics — a battle that pitted him against
experienced Washington insiders like Vice President Biden, who argued that a prolonged counterinsurgency campaign in
Afghanistan would plunge America into a military quagmire without weakening international terrorist networks. ""The entire
COIN strategy is a fraud perpetuated on the American people,"" says Douglas Macgregor, a retired colonel and leading
critic of counterinsurgency who attended West Point with McChrystal. ""The idea that we are going to spend a trillion
dollars to reshape the culture of the Islamic world is utter nonsense.
In the end, however, McChrystal got almost exactly what he wanted. On December 1st, in a speech at West Point, the
president laid out all the reasons why fighting the war in Afghanistan is a bad idea: It's expensive; we're in an economic
crisis; a decade-long commitment would sap American power; Al Qaeda has shifted its base of operations to Pakistan.

Then, without ever using the words ""victory"" or ""win,"" Obama announced that he would send an additional 30,000 troops
to Afghanistan, almost as many as McChrystal had requested. The president had thrown his weight, however hesitantly,
behind the counterinsurgency crowd.
Today, as McChrystal gears up for an offensive in southern Afghanistan, the prospects for any kind of success look bleak.
In June, the death toll for U.S. troops passed 1,000, and the number of IEDs has doubled. Spending hundreds of billions
of dollars on the fifth-poorest country on earth has failed to win over the civilian population, whose attitude toward U.S.
troops ranges from intensely wary to openly hostile. Thetiggest military operation of the year — a ferocious offensive that
began in February to retake the southern town of Marja — continues to drag on, prompting McChrystal himself to refer to it
as a ""bleeding ulcer."" In June, Afghanistan officially outpaced Vietnam as the longest war in American history — and
Obama has quietly begun to back away from the deadline he set for withdrawing U.S. troops in July of next year. The
president finds himself stuck in something even more insane than a quagmire: a quagmire he knowingly walked into, even
though it's precisely the kind of gigantic, mind-numbing, multigenerational nation-building project he explicitly said he
didn't want.
Even those who support McChrystal and his strategy of counterinsurgency know that whatever the general manages to
accomplish in Afghanistan, it's going to look more like Vietnam than Desert Storm. ""It's not going to look like a win, smell
like a win or taste like a win,"" says Maj. Gen. Bill Mayville, who serves as chief of operations for McChrystal. ""This is going
to end in an argument.""
The night after his speech in Paris, McChrystal and his staff head to Kitty O'Shea's, an Irish pub catering to tourists,
around the corner from the hotel. His wife, Annie, has joined him for a rare visit: Since the Iraq War began in 2003, she
has seen her husband less than 30 days a year. Though it is his and Annie's 33rd wedding anniversary, McChrystal has
invited his inner circle along for dinner and drinks at the ""least Gucci"" place his staff could find. His wife isn't surprised.
""He once took me to a Jack in the Box when I was dressed in formalwear,"" she says with a laugh.
The general's staff is a handpicked collection of killers, spies, geniuses, patriots, political operators and outright maniacs.
There's a former head of British Special Forces, two Navy Seals, an Afghan Special Forces commando, a lawyer, two
fighter pilots and at least two dozen combat veterans and counterinsurgency experts. They jokingly refer to themselves as
Team America, taking the name from the South Park-esque sendup of military cluelessness, and they pride themselves
on their can-do attitude and their disdain for authority. After arriving in Kabul last summer, Team America set about
changing the culture of the International Security Assistance Force, as the NATO-led mission is known. (U.S. soldiers had
taken to deriding ISAF as short for ""I Suck at Fighting"" or ""In Sandals and Flip-Flops."") McChrystal banned alcohol on
base, kicked out Burger King and other symbols of American excess, expanded the morning briefing to include thousands
of officers and refashioned the command center into a Situational Awareness Room, a free-flowing information hub
modeled after Mayor Mike Bloomberg's offices in New York. He also set a manic pace for his staff, becoming legendary
for sleeping four hours a night, running seven miles each morning, and eating one meal a day. (In the month I spend
around the general, I witness him eating only once.) It's a kind of superhuman narrative that has built up around him, a
staple in almost every media profile, as if the ability to go without sleep and food translates into the possibility of a man
single-handedly winning the war.
By midnight at Kitty O'Shea's, much of Team America is completely shitfaced. Two officers do an Irish jig mixed with steps
from a traditional Afghan wedding dance, while McChrystal's top advisers lock arms and sing a slurred song of their own
invention.""Afghanistan!"" they bellow.""Afghanistan!"" They call it their Afghanistan song.
McChrystal steps away from the circle, observing his team. ""All these men,"" he tells me. ""I'd die for them. And they'd die
for me.""
The assembled men may look and sound like a bunch of combat veterans letting off steam, but in fact this tight-knit group
represents the most powerful force shaping U.S. policy in Afghanistan. While McChrystal and his men are in indisputable
command of all military aspects of the war, there is no equivalent position on the diplomatic or political side. Instead, an
assortment of administration players compete over the Afghan portfolio: U.S. Ambassador Karl Eikenberry, Special
Representative to Afghanistan Richard Holbrooke, National Security Advisor Jim Jones and Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton, not to mention 40 or so other coalition ambassadors and a host of talking heads who try to insert themselves into
the mess, from John Kerry to John McCain. This diplomatic incoherence has effectively allowed McChrystal's team to call
the shots and hampered efforts to build a stable and credible government in Afghanistan. ""It jeopardizes the mission,""
says Stephen Biddle, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who supports McChrystal. ""The military cannot
by itself create governance reform.""
Part of the problem is structural: The Defense Department budget exceeds $600 billion a year, while the State
Department receives only $50 billion. But part of the problem is personal: In private, Team McChrystal likes to talk shit
about many of Obama's top people on the diplomatic side. One aide calls Jim Jones, a retired four-star general and
veteran of the Cold War, a ""clown"" who remains ""stuck in 1985."" Politicians like McCain and Kerry, says another aide,
""turn up, have a meeting with Karzai, criticize him at the airport press conference, then get back for the Sunday talk
shows. Frankly, it's not very helpful."" Only Hillary Clinton receives good reviews from McChrystal's inner circle. ""Hillary
had Stan's back during the strategic review,"" says an adviser. ""She said, 'If Stan wants it, give him what he needs.'""
McChrystal reserves special skepticism for Holbrooke, the official in charge of reintegrating the Taliban. ""The Boss says
he's like a wounded animal,"" says a member of the general's team. ""Holbrooke keeps hearing rumors that he's going to

get fired, so that makes him dangerous. He's a brilliant guy, but he just comes in, pulls on a lever, whatever he can grasp
onto. But this is COIN, and you can't just have someone yanking on shit.""
At one point on his trip to Paris, McChrystal checks his BlackBerry. ""Oh, not another e-mail from Holbrooke,"" he groans. ""I
don't even want to open it."" He clicks on the message and reads the salutation out loud, then stuffs the BladkBerry back in
his pocket, not bothering to conceal his annoyance.
""Make sure you don't get any of that on your leg,"" an aide jokes, referring to the e-mail.
By far the most crucial — and strained — relationship is between McChrystal and Eikenberry, the U.S. ambassador.
According to those close to the two men, Eikenberry — a retired three-star general who served in Afghanistan in 2002 and
2005 — can't stand that his former subordinate is now calling the shots. He's also furious that McChrystal, backed by
NATO's allies, refused to put Eikenberry in the pivotal role of viceroy in Afghanistan, which would have made him the
diplomatic equivalent of the general. The job instead went to British Ambassador Mark Sedwill — a move that effectively
increased McChrystal's influence over diplomacy by shutting out a powerful rival. ""In reality, that position needs to be filled
by an American for it to have weight,"" says a U.S. official familiar with the negotiations.
The relationship was further strained in January, when a classified cable that Eikenberry wrote was leaked to The New
York Times. The cable was as scathing as it was prescient. The ambassador offered a brutal critique of McChrystal's
strategy, dismissed President Hamid Karzai as ""not an adequate strategic partner,"" and cast doubt on whether the
counterinsurgency plan would be ""sufficient"" to deal with Al Qaeda. ""We will become more deeply engaged here with no
way to extricate ourselves,"" Eikenberry warned, ""short of allowing the country to descend again into lawlessness and
chaos.""
McChrystal and his team were blindsided by the cable. ""I like Karl, I've known him for years, but they'd never said
anything like that to us before,"" says McChrystal, who adds that he felt ""betrayed"" by the leak. ""Here's one that covers his
flank for the history books. Now if we fail, they can say, 'I told you so.'""
The most striking example of McChrystal's usurpation of diplomatic policy is his handling of Karzai. It is McChrystal, not
diplomats like Eikenberry or Holbrooke, who enjoys the best relationship with the man America is relying on to lead
Afghanistan. The doctrine of counterinsurgency requires a credible government, and since Karzai is not considered
credible by his own people, McChrystal has worked hard to make him so. Over the past few months, he has accompanied
the president on more than 10 trips around the country, standing beside him at political meetings, or shuras, in Kandahar.
In February, the day before the doomed offensive in Marja, McChrystal even drove over to the president's palace to get
him to sign off on what would be the largest military operation of the year. Karzai's staff, however, insisted that the
president was sleeping off a cold and could not be disturbed. After several hours of haggling, McChrystal finally enlisted
the aid of Afghanistan's defense minister, who persuaded Karzai's people to wake the president from his nap.
This is one of the central flaws with McChrystal's counterinsurgency strategy: The need to build a credible government
puts us at the mercy of whatever tin-pot leader we've backed — a danger that Eikenberry explicitly warned about in his
cable. Even Team McChrystal privately acknowledges that Karzai is a less-than-ideal partner. ""He's been locked up in his
palace the past year,"" laments one of the general's top advisers. At times, Karzai himself has actively undermined
McChrystal's desire to put him in charge. During a recent visit to Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Karzai met three U.S.
soldiers who had been wounded in Uruzgan province. ""General,"" he called out to McChrystal, ""I didn't even know we were
fighting in Uruzgan!""
Growing up as a military brat, McChrystal exhibited the mixture of brilliance and cockiness that would follow him
throughout his career. His father fought in Korea and Vietnam, retiring as a two-star general, and his four brothers all
joined the armed services. Moving around to different bases, McChrystal took solace in baseball, a sport in which he
made no pretense of hiding his superiority: In Little League, he would call out strikes to the crowd before whipping a
fastball down the middle.
McChrystal entered West Point in 1972, when the U.S. military was close to its all-time low in popularity. His class was the
last to graduate before the academy started to admit women. The ""Prison on the Hudson,"" as it was known then, was a
potent mix of testosterone, hooliganism and reactionary patriotism. Cadets repeatedly trashed the mess hall in food fights,
and birthdays were celebrated with a tradition called ""rat fucking,"" which often left the birthday boy outside in the snow or
mud, covered in shaving cream. ""It was pretty out of control,"" says Lt. Gen. David Barno, a classmate who went on to
serve as the top commander in Afghanistan from 2003 to 2005. The class, filled with what Barno calls ""huge talent"" and
""wild-eyed teenagers with a strong sense of idealism,"" also produced Gen. Ray Odierno, the current commander of U.S.
forces in Iraq.
The son of a general, McChrystal was also a ringleader of the campus dissidents — a dual role that taught him how to
thrive in a rigid, top-down environment while thumbing his nose at authority every chance he got. He accumulated more
than 100 hours of demerits for drinking, partying and insubordination — a record that his classmates boasted made him a
""century man."" One classmate, who asked not to be named, recalls finding McChrystal passed out in the shower after
downing a case of beer he had hidden under the sink. The troublemaking almost got him kicked out, and he spent hours
subjected to forced marches in the Area, a paved courtyard where unruly cadets were disciplined. ""I'd come visit, and I'd

end up spending most of my time in the library, while Stan was in the Area,"" recalls Annie, who began dating McChrystal
in 1973.
McChrystal wound up ranking 298 out of a class of 855, a serious underachievement for a man widely regarded as
brilliant. His most compelling work was extracurricular: As managing editor of The Pointer, the West Point literary
magazine, McChrystal wrote seven short stories that eerily foreshadow many of the issues he would confront in his
career. In one tale, a fictional officer complains about the difficulty of training foreign troops to fight; in another, a 19-year-
old soldier kills a boy he mistakes for a terrorist. In ""Brinkman's Note,"" a piece of suspense fiction, the unnamed narrator
appears to be trying to stop a plot to assassinate the president. It turns out, however, that the narrator himself is the
assassin, and he's able to infiltrate the White House: ""The President strode in smiling. From the right coat pocket of the
raincoat I carried, I slowly drew forth my 32-caliber pistol. In Brinkman's failure, I had succeeded.""
After graduation, 2nd Lt. Stanley McChrystal entered an Army that was all but broken in the wake of Vietnam. ""We really
felt we were a peacetime generation,"" he recalls. ""There was the Gulf War, but even that didn't feel like that big of a deal.""
So McChrystal spent his career where the action was: He enrolled in Special Forces school and became a regimental
commander of the 3rd Ranger Battalion in 1986. It was a dangerous position, even in peacetime — nearly two dozen
Rangers were killed in training accidents during the Eighties. It was also an unorthodox career path: Most soldiers who
want to climb the ranks to general don't go into the Rangers. Displaying a penchant for transforming systems he considers
outdated, McChrystal set out to revolutionize the training regime for the Rangers. He introduced mixed martial arts,
required every soldier to qualify with night-vision goggles on the rifle range and forced troops to build up their endurance
with weekly marches involving heavy backpacks.
In the late 1990s, McChrystal shrewdly improved his inside game, spending a year at Harvard's Kennedy School of
Government and then at the Council on Foreign Relations, where he co-authored a treatise on the merits and drawbacks
of humanitarian interventionism. But as he moved up through the ranks, McChrystal relied on the skills he had learned as
a troublemaking kid at West Point: knowing precisely how far he could go in a rigid military hierarchy without getting
tossed out. Being a highly intelligent badass, he discovered, could take you far — especially in the political chaos that
followed September 11th. ""He was very focused,"" says Annie. ""Even as a young officer he seemed to know what he
wanted to do. I don't think his personality has changed in all these years.""
By some accounts, McChrystal's career should have been over at least two times by now. As Pentagon spokesman
during the invasion of Iraq, the general seemed more like a White House mouthpiece than an up-and-coming commander
with a reputation for speaking his mind. When Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld made his infamous ""stuff happens""
remark during the looting of Baghdad, McChrystal backed him up. A few days later, he echoed the president's Mission
Accomplished gaffe by insisting that major combat operations in Iraq were over. But it was during his next stint —
overseeing the military's most elite units, including the Rangers, Navy Seals and Delta Force — that McChrystal took part
in a cover-up that would have destroyed the career of a lesser man.
After Cpl. Pat Tillman, the former-NFL-star-turned-Ranger, was accidentally killed by his own troops in Afghanistan in April
2004, McChrystal took an active role in creating the impression that Tillman had died at the hands of Taliban fighters. He
signed off on a falsified recommendation for a Silver Star that suggested Tillman had been killed by enemy fire.
(McChrystal would later claim he didn't read the recommendation closely enough — a strange excuse for a commander
known for his laserlike attention to minute details.) A week later, McChrystal sent a memo up the chain of command,
specifically warning that President Bush should avoid mentioning the cause of Tillman's death. ""If the circumstances of
Corporal Tillman's death become public,"" he wrote, it could cause ""public embarrassment"" for the president.
""The false narrative, which McChrystal clearly helped construct, diminished Pat's true actions,"" wrote Tillman's mother,
Mary, in her book Boots on the Ground by Dusk. McChrystal got away with it, she added, because he was the ""golden
boy"" of Rumsfeld and Bush, who loved his willingness to get things done, even if it included bending the rules or skipping
the chain of command. Nine days after Tillman's death, McChrystal was promoted to major general.
Two years later, in 2006, McChrystal was tainted by a scandal involving detainee abuse and torture at Camp Nama in
Iraq. According to a report by Human Rights Watch, prisoners at the camp were subjected to a now-familiar litany of
abuse: stress positions, being dragged naked through the mud. McChrystal was not disciplined in the scandal, even
though an interrogator at the camp reported seeing him inspect the prison multiple times. But the experience was so
unsettling to McChrystal that he tried to prevent detainee operations from being placed under his command in
Afghanistan, viewing them as a ""political swamp,"" according to a U.S. official. In May 2009, as McChrystal prepared for
his confirmation hearings, his staff prepared him for hard questions about Camp Nama and the Tillman cover-up. But the
scandals barely made a ripple in Congress, and McChrystal was soon on his way back to Kabul to run the war in
Afghanistan.
The media, to a large extent, have also given McChrystal a pass on both controversies. Where Gen. Petraeus is kind of a
dweeb, a teacher's pet with a Ranger's tab, McChrystal is a snake-eating rebel, a ""Jedi"" commander, as Newsweek called
him. He didn't care when his teenage son came home with blue hair and a mohawk. He speaks his mind with a candor
rare for a high-ranking official. He asks for opinions, and seems genuinely interested in the response. He gets briefings on
his iPod and listens to books on tape. He carries a custom-made set of nunchucks in his convoy engraved with his name
and four stars, and his itinerary often bears a fresh quote from Bruce Lee. (""There are no limits. There are only plateaus,
and you must not stay there, you must go beyond them."") He went out on dozens of nighttime raids during his time in Iraq,
unprecedented for a top commander, and turned up on missions unannounced, with almost no entourage. ""The fucking

lads love Stan McChrystal,"" says a British officer who serves in Kabul. ""You'd be out in Somewhere, Iraq, and someone
would take a knee beside you, and a corporal would be like 'Who the fuck is that?' And it's fucking Stan McChrystal.""
It doesn't hurt that McChrystal was also extremely successful as head of the Joint Special Operations Command, the elite
forces that carry out the government's darkest ops. During the Iraq surge, his team killed and captured thousands of
insurgents, including Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq. ""JSOC was a killing machine,"" says Maj. Gen.
Mayville, his chief of operations. McChrystal was also open to new ways of killing. He systematically mapped out terrorist
networks, targeting specific insurgents and hunting them down — often with the help of cyberfreaks traditionally shunned
by the military. ""The Boss would find the 24-year-old kid with a nose ring, with some fucking brilliant degree from MIT,
sitting in the corner with 16 computer monitors humming,"" says a Special Forces commando who worked with McChrystal
in Iraq and now serves on his staff in Kabul. ""He'd say, 'Hey — you fucking muscleheads couldn't find lunch without help.
You got to work together with these guys.'""
Even in his new role as America's leading evangelist for counterinsurgency, McChrystal retains the deep-seated instincts
of a terrorist hunter. To put pressure on the Taliban, he has upped the number of Special Forces units in Afghanistan from
four to 19. ""You better be out there hitting four or five targets tonight,"" McChrystal will tell a Navy Seal he sees in the
hallway at headquarters. Then he'll add, ""I'm going to have to scold you in the morning for it, though."" In fact, the general
frequently finds himself apologizing for the disastrous consequences of counterinsurgency. In the first four months of this
year, NATO forces killed some 90 civilians, up 76 percent from the same period in 2009 — a record that has created
tremendous resentment among the very population that COIN theory is intent on winning over. In February, a Special
Forces night raid ended in the de"						
ths of two pregnant Afghan women and allegations of a cover-up	 and in April	 protests						
erupted in Kandahar after U.S. forces accidentally shot up a bus	 killing five Afghans. ""We've shot an amazing number of							
people	 McChrystal recently conceded.							
Despite the tragedies and miscues	 McChrystal has issued some of the strictest directives to avoid civilian casualties that							
the U.S. military has ever encountered in a war zone. It's ""insurgent math	 as he calls it — for every innocent person you							
kill	 you create 10 new enemies. He has ordered convoys to curtail their reckless driving	 put restrictions on the use of air						
power and severely limited night raids. He regularly apologizes to Hamid Karzai when civilians are killed	 and berates							
commanders responsible for civilian deaths. ""For a while	 says one U.S. official	 ""the most dangerous place to be in						
Afghanistan was in front of McChrystal after a 'civ cas' incident."" The ISAF command has even discussed ways to make								
not killing into something you can win an award for: There's talk of creating a new medal for ""courageous restraint	 a							
buzzword that's unlikely to gain much traction in the gung-ho culture of the U.S. military.								
But however strategic they may be	 McChrystal's new marching orders have caused an intense backlash among his own							
troops. Being told to hold their fire	 soldiers complain	 puts them in greater danger. ""Bottom line?"" says a former Special						
Forces operator who has spent years in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""I would love to kick McChrystal in the nuts. His rules of								
engagement put soldiers' lives in even greater danger. Every real soldier will tell you the same thing.""								
In March	 McChrystal traveled to Combat Outpost JFM — a small encampment on the outskirts of Kandahar — to confront							
such accusations from the troops directly. It was a typically bold move by the general. Only two days earlier	 he had							
received an e-mail from Israel Arroyo	 a 25-year-old staff sergeant who asked McChrystal to go on a mission with his unit.							
I am writing because it was said you don't care about the troops and have made it harder to defend ourselves	 Arroyo							
wrote.								
Within hours	 McChrystal responded personally: ""I'm saddened by the accusation that I don't care about soldiers	 as it is						
something I suspect any soldier takes both personally and professionally — at least I do. But I know perceptions depend								
upon your perspective at the time	 and I respect that every soldier's view is his own."" Then he showed up at Arroyo's							
outpost and went on a foot patrol with the troops — not some bullshit photo-op stroll through a market	 but a real live							
operation in a dangerous war zone.								
Six weeks later	 just before McChrystal returned from Paris	 the general received another e-mail from Arroyo. A 23-year-						
old corporal named Michael Ingram — one of the soldiers McChrystal had gone on patrol with — had been killed by an IED								
a day earlier. It was the third man the 25-member platoon had lost in a year	 and Arroyo was writing to see if the general							
would attend Ingram's memorial service. ""He started to look up to you	 Arroyo wrote. McChrystal said he would try to							
make it down to pay his respects as soon as possible.								
The night before the general is scheduled to visit Sgt. Arroyo's platoon for the memorial	 I arrive at Combat Outpost JFM							
to speak with the soldiers he had gone on patrol with. JFM is a small encampment	 ringed by high blast walls and guard							
towers. Almost all of the soldiers here have been on repeated combat tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan	 and have seen							
some of the worst fighting of both wars. But they are especially angered by Ingram's death. His commanders had								
repeatedly requested permission to tear down the house where Ingram was killed	 noting that it was often used as a							
combat position by the Taliban. But due to McChrystal's new restrictions to avoid upsetting civilians	 the request had been							
denied. ""These were abandoned houses	 fumes Staff Sgt. Kennith Hicks. ""Nobody was coming back to live in them.""							
One soldier shows me the list of new regulations the platoon was given. ""Patrol only in areas that you are reasonably								
certain that you will not have to defend yourselves with lethal force	 the laminated card reads. For a soldier who has							
traveled halfway around the world to fight	 that's like telling a cop he should only patrol in areas where he knows he won't							
have to make arrests. ""Does that make any fucking sense?"" asks Pfc. Jared Pautsch. ""We should just drop a fucking								
bomb on this place. You sit and ask yourself: What are we doing here?""								
The rules handed out here are not what McChrystal intended — they've been distorted as they passed through the chain of								
command — but knowing that does nothing to lessen the anger of troops on the ground. ""Fuck	 when I came over here and

heard that McChrystal was in charge	 I thought we would get our fucking gun on	 says Hicks	 who has served three tours					
of combat. ""I get COIN. I get all that. McChrystal comes here	 explains it	 it makes sense. But then he goes away on his						
bird	 and by the time his directives get passed down to us through Big Army	 they're all fucked up — either because						
somebody is trying to cover their ass	 or because they just don't understand it themselves. But we're fucking losing this							
thing.""								
McChrystal and his team show up the next day. Underneath a tent	 the general has a 45-minute discussion with some two							
dozen soldiers. The atmosphere is tense. ""I ask you what's going on in your world	 and I think it's important for you all to							
understand the big picture as well	 McChrystal begins. ""How's the company doing? You guys feeling sorry for							
yourselves? Anybody? Anybody feel like you're losing?"" McChrystal says.								
Sir	 some of the guys here	 sir	 think we're losing	 sir	 says Hicks.			
McChrystal nods. ""Strength is leading when you just don't want to lead	 he tells the men. ""You're leading by example.							
That's what we do. Particularly when it's really	 really hard	 and it hurts inside."" Then he spends 20 minutes talking about						
counterinsurgency	 diagramming his concepts and principles on a whiteboard. He makes COIN seem like common sense							
but he's careful not to bullshit the men. ""We are knee-deep in the decisive year	 he tells them. The Taliban	 he insists	 no					
longer has the initiative — ""but I don't think we do	 either."" It's similar to the talk he gave in Paris	 but it's not winning any						
hearts and minds among the soldiers. ""This is the philosophical part that works with think tanks	 McChrystal tries to joke.							
But it doesn't get the same reception from infantry companies.""								
During the question-and-answer period	 the frustration boils over. The soldiers complain about not being allowed to use							
lethal force	 about watching insurgents they detain be freed for lack of evidence. They want to be able to fight — like they							
did in Iraq	 like they had in Afghanistan before McChrystal. 'We aren't putting fear into the Taliban	 one soldier says.						
Winning hearts and minds in COIN is a coldblooded thing	 McChrystal says	 citing an oft-repeated maxim that you can't						
kill your way out of Afghanistan. ""The Russians killed 1 million Afghans	 and that didn't work.""							
I'm not saying go out and kill everybody	 sir	 the soldier persists. ""You say we've stopped the momentum of the						
insurgency. I don't believe that's true in this area. The more we pull back	 the more we restrain ourselves	 the stronger it's						
getting.""								
I agree with you	 McChrystal says. ""In this area	 we've not made progress	 probably. You have to show strength here					
you have to use fire. What I'm telling you is	 fire costs you. What do you want to do? You want to wipe the population out							
here and resettle it?""								
A soldier complains that under the rules	 any insurgent who doesn't have a weapon is immediately assumed to be a							
civilian. ""That's the way this game is	 McChrystal says. ""It's complex. I can't just decide: It's shirts and skins	 and we'll kill						
all the shirts.""								
As the discussion ends	 McChrystal seems to sense that he hasn't succeeded at easing the men's anger. He makes one							
last-ditch effort to reach them	 acknowledging the death of Cpl. Ingram. ""There's no way I can make that easier	 he tells						
them. ""No way I can pretend it won't hurt. No way I can tell you not to feel that. . . . I will tell you	 you're doing a great job.							
Don't let the frustration get to you."" The session ends with no clapping	 and no real resolution. McChrystal may have sold							
President Obama on counterinsurgency	 but many of his own men aren't buying it.							
When it comes to Afghanistan	 history is not on McChrystal's side. The only foreign invader to have any success here							
was Genghis Khan — and he wasn't hampered by things like human rights	 economic development and press scrutiny.							
The COIN doctrine	 bizarrely	 draws inspiration from some of the biggest Western military embarrassments in recent						
memory: France's nasty war in Algeria (lost in 1962) and the American misadventure in Vietnam (lost in 1975).								
McChrystal	 like other advocates of COIN	 readily acknowledges that counterinsurgency campaigns are inherently messy						
expensive and easy to lose. ""Even Afghans are confused by Afghanistan	 he says. But even if he somehow manages to							
succeed	 after years of bloody fighting with Afghan kids who pose no threat to the U.S. homeland	 the war will do little to						
shut down Al Qaeda	 which has shifted its operations to Pakistan. Dispatching 150	000 troops to build new schools						
roads	 mosques and water-treatment facilities around Kandahar is like trying to stop the drug war in Mexico by occupying							
Arkansas and building Baptist churches in Little Rock. ""It's all very cynical	 politically	 says Marc Sageman	 a former CIA					
case officer who has extensive experience in the region. ""Afghanistan is not in our vital interest — there's nothing for us								
there.""								
In mid-May	 two weeks after visiting the troops in Kandahar	 McChrystal travels to the White House for a high-level visit by						
Hamid Karzai. It is a triumphant moment for the general	 one that demonstrates he is very much in command — both in							
Kabul and in Washington. In the East Room	 which is packed with journalists and dignitaries	 President Obama sings the						
praises of Karzai. The two leaders talk about how great their relationship is	 about the pain they feel over civilian							
casualties. They mention the word ""progress"" 16 times in under an hour. But there is no mention of victory. Still	 the •							
session represents the most forceful commitment that Obama has made to McChrystal's strategy in months. ""There is no								
denying the progress that the Afghan people have made in recent years — in education	 in health care and economic							
development	 the president says. ""As I saw in the lights across Kabul when I landed — lights that would not have been							
visible just a few years earlier.""								
It is a disconcerting observation for Obama to make. During the worst years in Iraq	 when the Bush administration had no							
real progress to point to	 officials used to offer up the exact same evidence of success. ""It was one of our first							
impressions	 one GOP official said in 2006	 after landing in Baghdad at the height of the sectarian violence. ""So many						
lights shining brightly."" So it is to the language of the Iraq War that the Obama administration has turned — talk of

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769954 Date: 08/31/2015								
progress	 of city lights	 of metrics like health care and education. Rhetoric that just a few years ago they would have						
mocked. ""They are trying to manipulate perceptions because there is no definition of victory — because victory is not even								
defined or recognizable	 says Celeste Ward	 a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation who served as a political						
adviser to U.S. commanders in Iraq in 2006. ""That's the game we're in right now. What we need	 for strategic purposes	 is						
to create the perception that we didn't get run off. The facts on the ground are not great	 and are not going to become							
great in the near future.""								
But facts on the ground	 as history has proven	 offer little deterrent to a military determined to stay the course. Even those						
closest to McChrystal know that the rising anti-war sentiment at home doesn't begin to reflect how deeply fucked up things								
are in Afghanistan. ""If Americans pulled back and started paying attention to this war	 it would become even less popular							
a senior adviser to McChrystal says. Such realism	 however	 doesn't prevent advocates of counterinsurgency from						
dreaming big: Instead of beginning to withdraw troops next year	 as Obama promised	 the military hopes to ramp up its						
counterinsurgency campaign even further. ""There's a possibility we could ask for another surge of U.S. forces next								
summer if we see success here	 a senior military official in Kabul tells me.							
Back in Afghanistan	 less than a month after the White House meeting with Karzai and all the talk of ""progress							
McChrystal is hit by the biggest blow to his vision of counterinsurgency. Since last year	 the Pentagon had been planning							
to launch a major military operation this summer in Kandahar	 the country's second-largest city and the Taliban's original							
home base. It was supposed to be a decisive turning point in the war — the primary reason for the troop surge that								
McChrystal wrested from Obama late last year. But on June 10th	 acknowledging that the military still needs to lay more							
groundwork	 the general announced that he is postponing the offensive until the fall. Rather than one big battle	 like						
Fallujah or Ramadi	 U.S. troops will implement what McChrystal calls a ""rising tide of security."" The Afghan police and							
army will enter Kandahar to attempt to seize control of neighborhoods	 while the U.S. pours $90 million of aid into the city							
to win over the civilian population.								
Even proponents of counterinsurgency are hard-pressed to explain the new plan. ""This isn't a classic operation	 says a							
U.S. military official. ""It's not going to be Black Hawk Down. There aren't going to be doors kicked in."" Other U.S. officials								
insist that doors are going to be kicked in	 but that it's going to be a kinder	 gentler offensive than the disaster in Marja.						
The Taliban have a jackboot on the city	 says a military official. ""We have to remove them	 but we have to do it in a way						
that doesn't alienate the population."" When Vice President Biden was briefed on the new plan in the Oval Office	 insiders							
say he was shocked to see how much it mirrored the more gradual plan of counterterrorism that he advocated last fall.								
This looks like CT-plus!"" he said	 according to U.S. officials familiar with the meeting.							
Whatever the nature of the new plan	 the delay underscores the fundamental flaws of counterinsurgency. After nine years							
of war	 the Taliban simply remains too strongly entrenched for the U.S. military to openly attack. The very people that							
COIN seeks to win over — the Afghan people — do not want us there. Our supposed ally	 President Karzai	 used his						
influence to delay the offensive	 and the massive influx of aid championed by McChrystal is likely only to make things							
worse. ""Throwing money at the problem exacerbates the problem	 says Andrew Wilder	 an expert at Tufts University who						
has studied the effect of aid in southern Afghanistan. ""A tsunami of cash fuels corruption	 delegitimizes the government

Nicholas D. Kristofs column could have been written by the peacemaking Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin or Israel's founder								
and first prime minister	 David Ben-Gurion	 if they were alive today.						
Mr. Rabin told me shortly before he was assassinated by a right-wing Israeli extremist that Israel	 while pursuing peace							
must never play into the hands of Palestinian terrorists	 who would try to sabotage the talks with attacks intended to							
provoke disproportionate retaliation. Yes	 Israel would fight the terrorists	 but not the Palestinian people. And it would						
certainly not initiate bloody conflict.								
Mr. Ben-Gurion told me that Israel would regret maintaining control of Arab-inhabited regions and another people after the								
1967 Six-Day War. He said the war would never end as long as Israel occupied the area	 an occupation he felt was both							
strategically and morally wrong.								
And if succeeding right-wing governments had taken his advice	 the war might well have been over years ago	 preventing						
Hamas from ruling Gaza	 giving Iran no excuse for threatening Israel with nuclear destruction	 and making life much						
easier for the United States.								
The Israeli assault on the pro-Palestinian flotilla is a symbolic result of the tragic survival-imperiling refutation by Israeli								
right-wingers of the visionary views of their country's two greatest leaders.

Day of the dead
More than 325 women have been murdered in the free-trade boomtown of Ciudad Juarez in the past decade. Faced with
government incompetence and corruption, people are rebelling.
By Max Blumenthal
Dec 4, 2002 I The body of another murdered woman was found late last month in the Mexican industrial hub of Ciudad
Juarez, dumped behind some shrubs in the squalor of the Anapra neighborhood, a ramshackle hodgepodge of corrugated
tin and cardboard shacks on the sludge-washed banks of the Rio Grande. Her hands had been tied, and the evidence
suggested she had been raped. The body was so badly decomposed that investigators calculated that she'd been dead
for seven months.
However horrific the details, they were numbing in their familiarity. The body of a woman who had died in similar
circumstances was found in the same dusty lot a couple of months earlier. The bodies of eight women were found in a lot
not far away a little more than a year ago. So many women have been murdered here in the past 10 years that there is no
reliable count. Most experts place it close to 325, an average of 32 a year, nearly three every month. At least 90 of the
deaths are believed to be the work of one or more serial killers. Hundreds more women have simply vanished.
Like so many of the others, the woman whose body was found in late October had probably come to Juarez from the
poverty of southern Mexico to work for about $10 a day in one of the many foreign-owned assembly plants known as
maquiladoras that sprouted up in Juarez after the North American Free Trade Agreement was signed in 1994. And like
them, too, her body was unclaimed in death and buried alone and anonymous.
Such death has become a way of life here. So, too, with the fear and paranoia that rise in such a climate. Nobody knows
who is doing the killings, and the mystery only seems to deepen. Arrests made by local authorities have produced
allegations of torture, witness tampering and frame-ups -- but no convictions. Most here believe that the killer or killers
must have enormous clout. Perhaps, some say, the killers are narcotrafficantes disposing of witnesses. Perhaps they are
the sons of the wealthy and powerful indulging in sick sex. Perhaps they are cultists whose members come from the
highest levels of government and finance. The theories differ, but a common assumption is that arrests made thus far are
only a smokescreen for an historically opaque and corrupt government that will protect its dark secrets at any cost.
One thing seems clear: The murders arise from a social landscape that has been transformed by global economic forces.
Where Ciudad Juarez was once a small, sleepy desert outpost just across the border from El Paso, Texas, the population
in the past decade has exploded to 1.2 million people, many of them drawn by the lure of the maquiladoras. The tides of
people have overwhelmed the ability of the city to absorb them, overwhelmed health services, social services and law
enforcement. Free-trade advocates once promised that NAFTA would transform Juarez into the City of the Future -- and
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768643 Date: 08/31/2015

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768643 Date: 08/31/2015
they have been proven right in a way they never could have imagined. Today, Juarez still has the feel of the lawless Old
West, but with a grim 21st century edge.
Despite promises of swift justice from Mexican President Vicente Fox and Chihuahua Gov. Patricio Martinez, they have
yet to take up offers of assistance from the FBI; bureau agents in Texas have suggested that official corruption is
hindering efforts to stop the murders. Chihuahua state investigators have seemingly adopted a ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy
towards Juarez's homicides, fostering an atmosphere of impunity and pervasive fear. Foreign corporations operating in
Juarez that have employed many of the murdered women largely deny that such an atmosphere exists.
But in this postmodern urban culture, where the very concept of community has broken down, many bereaved family
members and local activists have begun to take matters into their own hands, investigating the murders and speaking out
even if it means threats and other reprisals.
Evangeline Arce's daughter, Silvia, a street vendor, disappeared on Nov. 3, 1998. Since that day, she said, the authorities
have done little to investigate. ""Two days after my daughter disappeared, I went to the police and filed a report,"" the
mother says in Spanish, her face flaring with anger. ""They promised me prompt action but when I checked back a week
later, the Missing persons report was never filed and the investigation had not even begun. When they finally got
witnesses together, none of them would talk because they were too afraid.""
Even as Mexico continues to make strides toward becoming an open and democratic society, the epidemic of rape and
murder here has exposed the heavy residue of its corrupt and authoritarian political legacy as well as the contradictions of
its efforts at economic expansion.
To understand the magnitude of the breakdown, think of the sniper rampage in the Washington area this fall that left 10
people dead and three wounded. Imagine that Montgomery County Police Chief Charles Moose held a press conference
and asked local citizens to catch the sniper themselves because local police were not up to the task and the federal
government was not being helpful; imagine that the federal government charged that local officials in Montgomery County
were complicit in the killings and impeding the investigation. Chaos would ensue, certainly. But then, multiply. the number
of victims by 30, by 40, by 50, or more.
That's Juarez today.
The jumbled, exhaust-choked commercial core of this city has grown wildly in the wake of NAFTA, adding modern
shopping malls, condominiums and expansive boulevards. The population is growing at twice the rate of the national
average; it is expected to nearly double by 2010, to 2 million people. Many of them directly or indirectly rely on the 300 or
so maquiladoras for their livelihoods.
To accommodate the new army of workers, the city has given birth to entirely new sectors. The Campestre Juarez is a
luxurious conglomerate of gated communities, with a main gate that's a life-size replica of Paris' Arc de Triomphe. Nearby,
many of the maquiladoras are situated along the Avenida de la Industria. Though the assembly-line workers sometimes
can be glimpsed behind a plate glass window in aqua-blue uniforms, there usually is little sign of any activity behind the
maquiladoras' featureless walls.
Most of the new residents are poor, or on the brink of poverty, and they live in Anapra or another of the grim, violent
colonias populares on the outskirts of town. In those colonies, residents usually live without sanitation, running water,
electricity or paved roads.
Avenida Manuel Gomez Morin is the pothole-riddled six-lane avenue that ties these varied worlds together. Sitio Colosio
Valle, a medium-sized strip mall, stands on a corner of the avenue at the gateway to the industrial sector. It is fronted by a
vast parking lot and inside are various clothing outlets and boutiques. By day, the lot bustles as customers scurry back
and forth, hauling their purchases to their cars -- a sight similar to any mall in the suburban United States. By night,
however, traffic tapers off, stores lock up and the mall's lot becomes dark and desolate. Sitio Colosio Valle was where
many of the slain and missing women were last seen.
In the mall's parking lot, Braulio Rosas, a 40-year-old security guard, leans against the door of a giant Nike outlet. Inside
the store, under bright fluorescent lights, employees frantically check inventory and scramble to close up.
""A lot of girls were picked up here,"" Roses says in a voice of calm resignation. ""But really, it's the girls' fault. It's because
even though they weren't putas, [prostitutes] you know, they were more like fad/es [easy women]. They didn't have to get
into those cars if they didn't want to.""
Rosas sounds cynical, but blaming the victims is by no means an aberration in Juarez. Similar notions have been offered
by officials like Suly Ponce, the former Chihuahua special prosecutor in charge of the murdered women's cases.
""Sometimes there are cases that a girl meets some person, he strikes up a relationship with her, they drink ... and it ends
violently,"" she told the Washington Post in 2000, before she was promoted to a job in the governor's office. ""It's difficult to
know.""
A handful of the women found murdered since 1993 were indeed confirmed as prostitutes. But the truth is that a large
majority of the missing or murdered women were hardworking, young, poor and for the most part socially conservative.
Most had migrated to Juarez from Mexico's depressed south to work in the maquiladoras, sometimes arriving alone and
with little means of contacting their families back home.
The maquiladoras, run by companies like Delphi and RCA Thomson, prefer to hire young women for assembly-line jobs.
An entry-level assembly-line worker makes minimum wage, about $2 an hour. With experience, pay can rise to as much
as $2,50 an hour -- and compared to wages in Guerrero or Chiapas, that's good money. But in Juarez, the women are
caught in an economic trap: Since the cost of living here is only slighter lower than in El Paso, the wages that seem so
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768643 Date: 08/31/2015

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768643 Date: 08/31/2015
high to new maquiladora workers actually ensure poverty. The workers can be hired and fired on the spot, with little
pretext and no legal protection. And union activities are prohibited.
Even for those who accept the conditions, security is elusive. More often now, the global companies that own
maquiladoras are closing up shop and transferring operations to China to take advantage of lower taxes, investment
subsidies and outrageously cheap labor. On June 29, Royal Philips Electronics announced it was moving its P.C. monitor
manufacturing operations, at a cost of 900 jobs. On July 1, Scientific Atlanta fired 1,300 workers after shutting its plant
down. According to the Nov. 5 New York Times, this trend has cost Juarez 287,000 jobs in the maquiladoras since their
peak in October 2000.
Not only does this slash and burn the economic base. There are brutal social reverberations, too. The city's health
system, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, has reported 200,000 people falling from its list of insured after losing their
company policies, according to a July article in La Prensa. Esther Chavez Cano, director of Juarez's only battered-
women's shelter, Casa Amiga, said in a speech this summer that domestic violence cases had risen by 50 percent in July
alone.
The combination of poverty and a lack of social connections renders women on the assembly line powerless and virtually
invisible. And that has made them easy prey. According to the El Paso Times, about a third of the approximately 325 slain
women were employed by maquiladoras at the time of their murder.
Given that few of the maquiladoras provide shuttle service to and from the colonies, the female workers often are preyed
upon while walking through perilous places like Sitio Colosio Valle in the darkness of the early morning. At such an hour,
the only nearby activity is that of bars and nightclubs closing up as male patrons filter into the street after a long night of
drinking.
Besides China's attractive economic climate, an intangible cause of maquiladora flight is Juarez's chronic violence. The
effect is difficult to measure. Two companies in the city's industrial sector -- including TDK, the audio tape maker -- have
posted banners on their factories reading: ""STOP THE VIOLENCE. To Better Our City, Let's Unite."" But most foreign
companies are purely economic organisms governed entirely, it seems, by the dictates of efficiency. They have
maintained a stunning silence even as their female workers are slaughtered.
Consider the case of 17-year-old Claudia !vette Gonzalez. Her body was found in November 2001 along with seven
others in an overgrown cotton field on Avenida Technologico, just blocks from Sitio Colosio Valle mall and across the
street from the offices of the Association of Maquiladoras. She had worked on the assembly line for the Lear Corp., a
Detroit-based auto-interior supplier. Lear has declined to publicly address Gonzalez's murder.
Greg Bloom, editor of the Frontera Norte Sur -- an Internet news service that focuses on the U.S.-Mexico border --
recalled a conversation with Gonzalez's mother, Josefina, in which she recounted her daughter's last day. In the darkness
of the early morning, Gonzalez told him, Claudia set out for her job at Lear. When she arrived at work a few minutes late
after missing her bus, Claudia lvette was promptly sent away under a policy barring tardy assembly-line workers from their
shifts. A half-hour past when she usually would have returned home, her mother knew something was gravely wrong. Her
worst fear -- the same nagging fear shared by so many Juarez mothers -- would soon be realized.
Andrea Puchalsky, Lear's director of communications, acknowledged that the company has not made any public
statements regarding Gonzalez's murder, nor has it enacted any proactive measures to protect employees from another
wave of violence. ""Adding security is not a question that relates to Lear,"" she said. ""[Gonzalez's murder] did not happen
on Lear property.""
When questioned about the murder and Lear policies, Puchalsky mentioned that a company memo was prepared for her
with responses to possible questions. As to Lear's worker-lockout policy, which apparently put Gonzalez in a precarious
situation the day of her abduction, Puchalsky declined to comment on whether Gonzalez was locked out or sent home
from Lear's plant on her last day.
""We have a policy for tardiness and she was tardy many times,"" Puchalsky said. ""When she had arrived late to work her
shift, she was not there in time to work her shift.""
When asked whether Lear's offices in the U.S. have a similar policy in which late employees are barred from working their
shifts, Puchalsky reversed her earlier statement, vehemently denying that such a policy existed anywhere within Lear's
operations. ""There is not a policy to send a worker home after X number of tardy arrivals,"" she said. ""Typically what we do
is if there is someone arriving late on kind of a warning system, there might be a notification that 'the next time you arrive
late, you have to take a day off ...' It's not a policy, though. There is no written policy like that throughout Lear Corp.""
The body of 17-year-old Lilia Alejandra Garcia was found mutilated just 300 feet from her maquiladora in February 2001,
and since then her case has come to embody the incompetence and corruption of police and prosecutors from Ciudad
Juarez to the state capital in Chihuahua City and south all the way to Mexico City.
Garcia, the mother of a 5-month-old baby and a 2-year-old child, apparently was kidnapped just after she left work. She
was held in captivity for a week, repeatedly beaten and raped, and then strangled. Then-prosecutor Suly Ponce told the
Juarez newspaper El Diario that Garcia was the first woman of the year to be murdered and raped in this area of the city -
- even though two days before, the body of an unidentified woman was found naked just blocks away.
When an FBI leak revealed witness testimony linking Lilia Garcia's killers to drug dealers, Suly Ponce dismissed it, calling
it erroneous. She instead blamed workers in a circus across the street from the strip mall where Garcia was last seen.
When circus managers claimed that Ponce offered them money to blame co-workers, she dropped the investigation.

According to a July article in the El Paso Times, former Chihuahua state forensic chief Oscar Maynez Grijalva said Garcia
was killed in a similar manner as three of the eight women found in the cotton field with Claudia 'vette Gonzalez in
November 2001. Curiously, local authorities behaved just as evasively in that investigation as in Garcia's.
When Gonzalez and the seven other women's bodies were found in November 2001, ex-Chihuahua Attorney General
Arturo Gonzalez Rascon immediately fingered two local bus drivers as the culprits. Yet doubts about their guilt arose,
especially after Grijalva -- who was Rascon's evidence expert at the time -- resigned from his post, citing pressure to
fabricate evidence against them. And the head of a local prison was forced from office when he documented signs of
torture on the accused men after they had returned from Rascon's office.
Four months later, in February 2002, a search-and-rescue team combing the cotton field found Claudia lvette Gonzalez's
overalls in a plastic bag, along with strands of hair and other crucial pieces of evidence that Rascon's investigators had
failed to discover. In response, Rascon offered his opinion to the El Paso Times: ""The state police have done a thoroughly
professional job. I have no doubt about that."" But on Oct. 28, DNA results revealed that Rascon's investigators had
properly identified only one of the eight dead women -- Gonzalez.
Stuck with a far more dubious task than catching one madman or replacing one feeble leader, Juarez's fractured civil
society has been paralyzed. A cynical mood is palpable just by speaking to citizens on the street, who unanimously
express fear and distrust of law-enforcement and government officials. Some local cops are just as cynical.
""We can't just sit around in deserted places waiting for someone to drive up and dump bodies off,"" said one municipal
police officer seated in an idling paddy wagon who refused to give his name for security reasons. ""There are too few of us
and the city's too big ... We don't get much support from the federal government. Judicially, we are not protected like cops
in the U.S. Plus, the arms they give us are weak and the bulletproof vests don't really stop bullets. It's not just that,
though. I have a young woman in my home so I can put myself in the place of the parents who have lost their daughters.
But it's a question of society. We need their support and they need them to be more conscious if it is going to get any
better here.""
The scope of the crime is so enormous, and there has been so little success in stopping it, that suspicion breeds on itself.
The litany of theories as to who the killers are and what their motive might be suggests that Juarez has become a
breeding ground for every imaginable predator. And yet, nobody knows. Nothing is certain. And that feeds the climate of
paranoia.
Garcia and Gonzalez's murders are rumored to be the work of a serial killer with possible ties to drug dealers. Yet Garcia
was found with marks on her wrists that, according to local forensics experts, were identical to those made by police
handcuffs. And upon the discovery of her daughter's overalls, Josefina Gonzalez told the El Paso Times that someone
powerful was undoubtedly responsible for the murder.
Many in Mexico's law enforcement community agree that a ring of rich men are behind some of the killings, but they have
no evidence to support the theory. Some suggest that some young men from the local aristocracy are responsible, but are
being protected by their parents. A persistent theory holds that the murders -- or a significant subset of them -- are linked
to powerful narcotraficantes who have co-opted segments of the local ruling class.
And the cynicism has been exacerbated by the fact that of the 17 men and one woman accused as serial killer
masterminds of the murders, only one has been convicted, Abdel Latif Sharif Sharif, an Egyptian chemist and resident of
Texas at the time of his extradition to Mexico in 1995. Currently, Sharif is awaiting sentencing for allegedly paying a drug
trafficker named Victor Manuel Rivera Moreno to carry out about a dozen murders. However, evidence against Sharif is
suspect and charges against him have been changed repeatedly. Once he was even charged with killing a woman,
Elizabeth Ontiveros, who showed up later at police offices to prove she was alive.
In 1996, Sharif was accused of paying the gang Los Rebeldes to kill 17 women. Then, in 1999, he was charged with hiring
five bus drivers and an El Paso man from his jail cell to kill seven women. Officials claimed Sharif hired the killers to
deflect blame from himself. By 1999, judges had cleared him of all charges, citing an absence of concrete evidence and
the possibility of witness intimidation by prosecutors.
Suly Ponce, who supervised the case, has yet to make a compelling case against him. In a 1999 radio interview, rather
than presenting hard evidence, she claimed Sharif was aggressively hostile toward women because of his Egyptian
background. Now she says that the case against Sharif hinges on Moreno's declaration that Sharif paid him to carry out
the killings with money he earned from 13 patents he developed for Benchmark Research and Technology. But according
to an article in the El Paso Times, Benchmark has never paid employees for patent development. In a telephone interview
last week with Salon, Ponce said she hadn't known this. Angela Paiaveras, the current special prosecutor, declined to
discuss Sharif's case or any aspect of the investigations.
Many local residents scoff at the notion that the killers have been caught. ""We don't believe that the guys they have
arrested are the killers,"" says Miguel Angel Jaramillo, a mid-level manager for the Lear Corp. ""It's obvious that they're just
scapegoats.""
Yet Ponce remains ardent in her belief that Sharif is at the center of the murders. ""Today the killings continue because
there are many imitators,"" she told Salon last week. ""But after Sharif was caught, there were almost no homicides for a
year."" But according to the Juarez daily El Diario, the year immediately after Sharif was jailed -- a period spanning from
October 1995 to October 1996 -- 28 young women were found murdered.
Meanwhile, the theories flourish and become more and more paranoid, reflecting a breakdown in public trust. By one
popular theory, the women are being murdered at blood rituals for a cabal of wealthy, powerful men. Another theory posits
a financial motive for murder. ""We're finding a lot of girls that are mutilated in the same way,"" says a young municipal

police officer who declined to give his name. ""Someone's probably killing them to take their organs to sell them for a lot of
money in the U.S."" When asked if there was any evidence to support the theory, the officer replied that it was only a
hunch.
Such a climate sends a message to the killers every day: You can get away with anything, even a crime on this scale. But
where such a climate breeds cynicism and hopelessness among people who live and work here, it has also provoked an
incipient revolt.
On her radio show ""Grueso Calibre"" (""Large Caliber""), popular host Samira lzaguirre frequently aired the views of guests
who were critical of how authorities handled the murders. When Attorney General Rascon accused the two bus drivers of
the cotton field murders in November 2001, lzaguirre hosted the drivers' wives on her show. After that interview,
advertisements began appearing in local newspapers smearing lzaguirre with claims that she frequented strip clubs and
was romantically involved with one of the bus drivers. News media on both sides of the border have reported that the
receipt for the ad was signed by government officials who paid for it.
Then, in February, when lzaguirre started organizing a vigil and announced a hunger strike on her show on Radio Canon,
she was fired. Fearing for her safety, she moved across the border to El Paso.
Others, too, have discovered that pressing the complaint too forcefully brings reprisal. Marisela Ortiz, co-director of
Nuestras Hijas Regreso a Casa (Our Daughters Back Home), a legal support group for victims' parents, was a frequent
guest on ""Grueso Calibre."" Like Izaguirre, Ortiz has focused her resources on drawing attention to government and police
incompetence in the slain women's cases. And she says that, like lzaguirre, she has faced ever-increasing danger.
In Nuestras Hijas' office in central Juarez, located inside a small one-story row house with a ""For Rent"" sign out front,
Ortiz described the shadow of terror that has stalked her since she began pressuring the authorities.
She claims she was threatened by ex-Chihuahua District Attorney Arturo Gonzalez Rascon. ""Rascon came all the way to
Juarez [from Chihuahua City] to tell me not to involve myself in all the cases,"" she tells Salon. ""Then I got a message on
my phone saying: 'You have daughters that are alive. Take care of them."" Rascon, in an earlier story by the Associated
Press, denied the allegation.
Last May, Ortiz says, she was pursued by men in a black pickup truck who tried to kidnap her. She believes the attempt
was orchestrated by Rascon's office since it occurred only a day before she had planned to travel to El Paso for a meeting
with the FBI and Texas state Sen. Eliot Shapleigh, D-El Paso, who is calling for a bi-national investigation into the
murders.
Victims' parents who came to Nuestras Hijas for help in finding their missing daughters also say they have been
threatened. Mario Lee Lopez and his wife, Soledad Aguilar, lost their daughter, Cecilia Covarrubias. She was kidnapped
in 1995 along with their granddaughter, who was two months old. By now their granddaughter would be 7, and Lopez and
Aguilar's own investigation has led them to believe that she is alive and living in the custody of a well-connected local
family.
To an outsider it is a desperate story, all but impossible to prove. Lopez accuses Ponce of coordinating the coverup of the
kidnappings and murder: again, Ponce denies the charge. And she was adamant that government officials have harassed
no one. ""I didn't have any knowledge of threats against anybody,"" she said. ""On the contrary, we support the families and
they are encouraged to be intimately involved in the investigations.""
Lopez recalls an incident in which he had gone to Juarez's judicial building to press his granddaughter's case and did not
exactly find the kind of support Ponce mentioned. While leaving the court, Lopez says, he was confronted by a high-
ranking minister who warned that if he didn't drop the investigation, he would be tortured with electric shock devices.
""But it's too late to stop now,"" Lopez adds with a wistful smile.
Despite the campaign against lzaguirre, or perhaps because of it, the vigil took place as scheduled in March. It was an
unprecedented show of solidarity, with thousands of people gathered in the cotton field where Gonzalez and the seven
others were found in an irrigation ditch. There are still tatters of yellow police tape there, and candleholders left from the
vigil are strewn over the site. Eight red crosses mark the spot where the bodies were found.
However, city officials have no plans to memorialize the site as Juarez's residents have. In fact, according to a Sept. 4
article in El Diario, the site is now being used as a dumping ground for Juarez's Department of Parks and Gardens.
Near downtown Juarez there is a monument to Abraham Lincoln, honoring him for ""establishing North American
industries, today the most important in the world."" Not far away is a simple gallery where the Collective Antigone [Antigone
Collective], a group of local artists, has organized a series of public performances, installations and conferences focused
on Juarez's crisis of violence.
Each week, the artists gather to collaborate and discuss strategy. At a table with 12 other artists and writers, in an
expansive room filled with cubist-inspired paintings, Antonio Munoz Ortega, a 51-year-old writer, describes the Collective's
goals and the problems confronting the group. ""Our government is authoritarian, and authoritarian governments are
principally concerned with the manipulation of life,"" he says. ""The victims' families feel manipulated by the authorities'
insensitivity and this has manifested a greater and greater cynicism here that's really dangerous. The struggle, then, is for
reparation and simply regaining our daily lives.""
Ortega says he was moved to action by Samira Izaguirre's candlelight vigil in March. He describes the building of an
impromptu church in front of the Association of Maquiladoras office as an effort to ""communicate through a different
language, one that's symbolic."" This decision, he says, helped lead to the formation of the Collective.

The rallying cry for Collectiva Antigona, as evidenced by the name, has been Sophocles Greek tragedy, ""Antigone,""
which tells the tale of a girl's persecution at the hands of a cruel dictator for burying her brother. The Collectiva has
organized readings of the play around the state of Chihuahua and plans a public performance in the future.
The Collectiva also has begun to establish a visual presence around central Juarez, most noticeably by painting a wall
spanning an entire block with poetry written by participants in a recent writer's conference on violence against women. On
Nov. 1 and 2, the Mexican holiday Dia de los Muertos, the collective filled a room with traditional altars honoring the
victims along with a giant cross in the center of the room covered with masks, intended to symbolize the anonymity of the
victims. An estimated 1,500 people viewed the exhibit. A week later, working with Nuestras Hijas, the collective placed a
coffin and flowers and had a bonfire in the cotton field ditch where Claudia Ivette Gonzalez and seven others were found.
""It is absolutely necessary to affect civil society with the intention of shaking the indolence and to provoke some sort of
reaction from the people,"" says Mariela Paniagua, a 41-year-old painter. ""People are no longer affected by what is
happening in this city. They have lost the capacity for outrage in the face of these acts.""
While Collectiva Antigona meets, another group gathers a few miles away to combat Juarez's violence by drastically
different means. Past the seemingly endless rows of cardboard hovels in the desperately poor CoIonia Morelos, beyond
the municipal dump, on a rocky desert mesa in the shadow of Mount Indio, members of a search-and-rescue group called
Banda Civil spread out through the hills to search for more murder victims.
Luz Elena Guerrero Guerra, a strong-looking woman in her late 50s with an intense gaze, serves as president of one of
Banda Civil's six divisions. Guerra tells of how it began as a search-and-rescue group in 1985 to assist during a massive
earthquake in Mexico City and evolved to respond to Juarez's crisis. She herself found the first slain women's bodies in
1989, before investigators had"							
even identified the deadly trend. Today	 Banda Civil's members still lend their help during							
natural disasters but the bulk of their work comes in the search for bodies	 monitoring of schools and a citywide crime-							
awareness campaign.								
Ever-present terror	 coupled with the impotence of Juarez's authorities	 forced Banda Civil's transformation	 Guerra says.					
I've narrowly escaped violence many times	 she explains. ""Sometimes it is just pure luck that a bus or a taxi happens to							
come by in time when someone is chasing me ... All of us	 we're uncertain of what the authorities are telling us. That's our							
indignation. If they [the authorities] aren't interested in helping	 we'll pressure them.""							
Because the group is required by law to cooperate with police	 some view it with suspicion. Yet they have had success							
where most other activist groups have failed. It was Banda Civil members who made the crucial discovery of Claudia								
lvette Gonzalez's overalls in February	 humiliating Attorney General Rascon and breathing new life into the investigation.							
And Banda Civil has continued to find more evidence during their weekly searches of Juarez's human dumping grounds.								
Besides its role as a search-and-rescue/quasi-vigilante group	 Banda Civil has the feel of a support group	 providing						
members with an outlet from the daily fear that comes with life in Juarez. According to Guerra	 over 300 people have							
accompanied the group on searches and many of them are family members of missing women. And indeed	 the searches							
are a family activity.								
On one recent Saturday	 the search was joined by about 60 participants of all ages and from all sectors of Juarez society							
including a middle manager from the Lear Corp. There were no terrible discoveries that day	 and yet afterward	 as people						
stood around talked and listened to norteno music blaring from a car stereo	 it was evident just how deeply the murders							
are ingrained into life here -- and how some people are fighting back with whatever tools they have at hand. Perhaps the								
quiet optimism is derived from the age-old Mexican axiom that death brings about rebirth.								
Instead of spending our time criticizing the authorities	 we're trying to find some solutions	 says Santos. ""We all have						
sisters and daughters here and we all feel the same. My daughter is in danger. I can't let her live like this.""

Istanbul's Fener district - which is under full and very visible police surveillance - shows that any ""protection"" is at best							
ineffectual. Those charged with protecting religious leaders have not managed to stop threats against them.							
Religious minority leaders live with threats constantly	 whether through the media or directly. Patriarch Mesrop would						
receive about 300 emailed threats each day -- whether from one individual or many is unknown. Unknown people watch							
religious minority buildings	 making sure they are seen and noticed by the religious minorities.						
Perhaps the biggest impact so far of this constant atmosphere of threats is on the Armenian Apostolic Patriarchate							
Turkey's biggest Christian denomination. Mesrop Mutafyan	 who was elected Patriarch in 1998 against the express						
wishes of the Turkish authorities	 has been forced to retreat into health-related seclusion. Many believe the severe						
health problems he is suffering -- which have affected him both physically and mentally - are akin to post-traumatic							
stress disorder. They believe these have been brought on by years of pressure from the media	 the public and from the						
Armenian diaspora	 some of which has dubbed him a traitor. As well as opposing his original election	 the Turkish					
authorities also made trouble for him over the restoration of the Patriarchate several years ago.							
Should Patriarch Mesrop not recover and be in a position to take up his functions again	 this could threaten the future of						
the Armenian Church in Turkey. The Turkish authorities are likely to insist -- as they have done up to now -- that the							
head of the Armenian (as well as the Greek Orthodox) Patriarchate must be a Turkish citizen resident in Turkey. The

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766344 Date: 07/31/2015							
Armenian Church may struggle to find a candidate with the diplomatic and linguistic skills and the international							
experience for such a crucial role in such a delicate and exposed position. This problem is of importance not just for the							
Church but for the Armenian community as a whole.							
However	 it is clear that Ergenekon and the ""deep state"" are not the only obstacle for freedom of religion or belief. Local						
officials -- who are almost certainly not in an Ergenekon-type organisation — continue to obstruct the work of non-							
Muslim communities. This can clearly be seen when it comes to property disputes.							
Roman Catholics	 for example	 face several difficult property battles	 most notably in the southern coastal city of Mersin				
where they have a large compound which they have used since Ottoman times. The only document the Catholics have							
confirming their ownership is a firman (decree) issued by the Ottoman sultan	 which the local authorities do not						
consider is valid. Successive court cases brought by the local authorities in the 1980s finally reached Turkey's Supreme							
Court in Ankara in the 1990s	 which ruled in favour of the Catholics.						
Such ownership problems are faced by all the minorities	 despite their widely differing legal status. As is the case with all						
non-Muslim minority groups	 Catholics do not legally exist. Furthermore	 as their properties are not organised as					
community foundations""	 their properties have no legal personality on their own. And as the Catholics do not legally						
exist	 the government at times argues that they therefore also cannot have property. This shows that despite						
government claims	 these property problems have not been resolved by the latest Foundations Law (see F18News 13						
March 2008).							
In the case of the Catholics of Mersin	 the local authorities re-started the dispute through the courts	 in a case that is					
now pending at the High Court. Catholics fear a negative ruling	 which would force them to take their case to the						
European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg. This would be extremely expensive and time-consuming	 even						
though this may turn out to be the only effective way for religious minorities to secure freedom of religion or belief (see							
F18News 18 January 2007).							
The authorities in Mersin argue that the Ottoman firman only allows Catholic people to construct a specific building (a							
church) and did not grant them ownership of the land on which it was built. Similar court cases were brought in the past							
over the Assumptionist Church in Kadikoy	 Istanbul (ECHR case No. 26308/95).						
The Mersin authorities' desire to confiscate Catholic property would leave the community with nowhere to worship							
though it remains unclear how far the authorities would go. They could take away legal ownership	 while allowing the						
Catholics to continue to use the church. In the past	 authorities elsewhere have used such methods to confiscate						
religious property ""legally"".							
Another example is in Adana. The town's Jesuit-run Catholic church has long faced harassment from local people							
attending a nearby wedding hall	 which was built close to it in defiance of regulations. The mayor's office has said that						
the wedding hall should be closed but has taken no action to enforce this.							
Ancient cemeteries where Christians are buried -- such as in Samsun — or Christian sections of bigger cemeteries -- as in							
Ankara - are also not being protected from vandalism	 despite requests from the Christian Churches. In the Black Sea						
port of Trabzon -- where Fr Santoro was murdered - the Christian cemetery is threatened with confiscation. Muslim							
cemeteries face no such problems.							
By contrast	 spokespersons for the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate have pointed to two positive developments. They

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766344 Date: 07/31/2015							
welcomed the January 2008 statement in parliament by the Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan that the issue of							
whether its Patriarch	 Bartholomew	 is ""Ecumenical"" or not is an ""internal"" matter for the Patriarchate and that the state					
should not interfere. Previously the authorities have responded ferociously to any claims that Bartholomew's religious							
role extends beyond Istanbul's tiny surviving Greek Orthodox community.							
Greek Orthodox spokespersons also welcome the July 2008 ruling by the ECHR in Strasbourg over the Buyukada							
orphanage	 particularly the finding that not only does the property belong to the Orthodox Patriarchate but that the						
Patriarchate is an existing legal person (application no. 14340/05).							
Erdogan's statement about the title ""Ecumenical"" is likely to have little immediate impact on the general public	 which						
continues to regard the Patriarchate with suspicion or hostility. The ECHR ruling should have an impact on other							
religious communities which have so far struggled to assert their right to a legal existence.							
Meanwhile a new party	 the Law and Equality Party (Hak ve Esitlik Partisi)	 was created on 4 September to promote a					
nationalist agenda. The party	 founded by a former general prominent in the war against the PKK Kurdish rebels	 is also					
aimed at getting rid of Christians and ending Christian proselytism. The first sentence of the call to found the party --							
published as a full-page advertisement in many newspapers - attacks what it calls the ""colonisation"" of Turkey by							
missionaries	 presumably Christian. ""Turkish nation -- we know that you are fed up that your democracy is treated like a						
child	 that foreign representatives and missionaries run around on our soil and boss you around	 it reads.					
Although the party seems to be well-organised in Turkey's provinces	 it remains unclear how serious it is and how many						
votes it might be able to gather in an election. Nevertheless	 the party reflects more widely-held chauvinist views	 which					
see no place in Turkey for non-Muslim minorities (see F18News 29 November 2007).							
Public opinion in Turkey is becoming more hostile to freedom of religion or belief	 and increasingly favours extreme						
nationalism of the Ergenekon kind. The government's actions are favourable to these kinds of views -- even if not to the							
Ergenekon group itself -- and it does not seem to want to act effectively to protect non-nationalist Turkish citizens. The							
ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) is not itself an extreme nationalist party	 but it could do much more to make						
it unambiguously clear that religious and ethnic minorities are Turkish citizens with equal rights.							
The AKP itself is under threat from Ergenekon-style views; indeed	 those associated with the ""deep state"" recently tried						
to have the AKP banned. A fight is underway between the Army and the old Kemalist ""deep state"" on one side and the							
AKP on the other. But it is not at all clear that the AKP is necessarily in this fight to advance democratic values	 including						
freedom of religion and belief.							
It also remains unclear whether the AKP will prevail. Visits by members of the General Staff to Ergenekon prisoners							
ahead of the trial have been interpreted as a warning to the AKP not to go too far.							
The court case against alleged key leaders and members of Ergenekon is merely the latest step in the power-struggle							
between the ""deep state"" (of which Ergenekon appears to have been a part) and the AKP. That the judiciary -- quite							
obviously pushed by the government -- has initiated the court case can be seen as proof that the AKP government is							
fighting back against those groups in society and state that are striving to drive the AKP from power.							
Whether the Ergenekon court case will prove to be a step towards real democracy in Turkey — leading to improvements							
in the area of freedom of religion and belief -- is quite another question. It is not only the court cases on Ergenekon and							
the Malatya murders which will decide this. Given the undeniable threats to the day-to-day security and religious

will be crucial in deciding this question.

According to an ANA correspondent in Ankara	 the unexploded grenade was spotted on the roof of St. George's

Turkish police said the grenade may have been thrown any time in the past month but went unnoticed because it							
did not explode.							
The Ecumenical Patriarchate has been the target of similar attacks several times in the past	 with grenades						
lobbed from the area behind the grounds and always landing near the same spot on the roof of the church. Past

Archbishop Demetrios Condemns Hostile Demonstrations Against Our Ecumenical							
Patriarchate

NEW YORK - Archbishop Demetrios of America has expressed his deepest sorrow and his strong and							
unequivocal condemnation for the most recent hostile demonstrations and threats against the holy center of							
world Orthodoxy	 the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople	 in Istanbul	 Turkey.				
This latest assault took place last Thursday	 October 28	 when groups of Turkish nationalists and other extreme					
elements demonstrated in Phanar against the Ecumenical Patriarchate chanting slogans such as ""one night we'll							
come to the Phanar	 ""go away Patriarch	 ""Patriarch don't test our patience	 ""take the Patriarchate and go to				
Greece	 and the like. Before police intervened	 the angry demonstrators reached the entrance to the Patriarchal					
compound	 and placed a black wreath in front of the gate.						
Archbishop Demetrios in his statement of condemnation said	 ""I express my deepest sorrow for the events that						
transpired outside of our Ecumenical Patriarchate last Thursday. The actions of these Turkish extremists-							
nationalists are appalling and condemnable in and by any civilized country. These are actions against a holy							
institution which survived and lives on through the centuries. It's an institution highly respected by the entire							
civilized world. These demonstrators are short changing themselves and Turkey	 as they paint a picture of						
uncivilized	 petty	 narrow-minded people.""

OFFICIAL STATEMENT							
BY HIS EMINENCE ARCHBISHOP SPYRIDON							
GREEK ORTHODOX ARCHDIOCESE OF AMERICA							
http://www.goarch.oranews/goa.news660							
His Eminence Archbishop Spyridon of America strongly condemned this latest criminal act of the bombing of the							
Ecumenical Patriarchate headquarters in Istanbul	 Turkey	 on December 3	1997				
Upon reflecting on this act of terror	 the serious wounding of a clergyman	 and the destruction of property of the					
Ecumenical Patriarchate	 His Eminence said:						
Six weeks after he received the Congressional Gold Medal	 the Ecumenical Patriarch was threatened by a bomb blast						
directed at him and his Church. This is unacceptable.							
At the dawn of the 21st century	 it is inconceivable that the basic human rights	 such as the freedom of worship	 the				
ability to live a peaceful life according to the law of one's country	 and the freedom to live without the constant fear of						
having ones life and property destroyed without cause	 are still abused and denied in countries such as Turkey.						
How can a person claim for himself to be civilized	 to be peace-loving	 to be respectful of human rights and to be treated					
as part of the civilized world when his own actions violate these universally accepted tenets of humanity.							
I condemn all violence and persecution of human beings everywhere	 for every person is gifted by God with dignity						
honor	 and the right to live a peaceful life.						
It is the responsibility of the Government of Turkey to provide safety and security for all of her citizens	 and to seriously						
obey the international rules which govern a civilized society.

world	 condemn this act of violence and terror that occurred at the heart of Orthodox Christianity. Along with the						
clergyman who was seriously injured as a result of this bombing	 over 300 million Orthodox Christians	 and in fact all					
people of good will	 have been wounded by this evil act.						
I simply ask myself and the world: Is it possible that after nearly 2	000 years of uninterrupted history that in the						
latter days of the 20th century	 the beacon of Orthodoxy the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople which						
provides the light of faith	 peace	 and universal hope for all people	 still lives in the shadows of such violent				
hatred?""

Some of the Explosives Used Against the Ecumenical Patriarch							
Constantinople's last hurrah: Turkey and the Ecumenical Patriarchate							
By Mason	 Whit						
Publication: World Policy Journal							
Date: Sunday	 July 1 2001						
Until quite recently	 most Turks regarded the prelate's headquarters as a den of Greek spies. Tarasios says that when						
he arrived in Istanbul ten years ago articles about the Patriarchate in the Turkish press were always negative	 often						
viciously so. In 1990	 an angry demonstration by some 40 Turks from Eastern Thrace	 in Greece	 shut down the.				
Patriarchate for several days. Police said they could do nothing. In 1994	 terrorists calling themselves the ""Fighters of						
Light"" threw a huge bomb	 which fortunately did not explode	 into the compound. After it was defused	 police found a				
note left by militants vowing they would battle ""until this place	 which for years has contrived Byzantine intrigues						
against the Muslim peoples of the East	 is exterminated."" In 1997	 another bomb bounced off the Church of St. George					
before exploding and seriously injuring a monk.""							
Had one of these bombs not been found by the gardener and defused by a bomb squad before it exploded the							
Ecumenical Patriarch would have been killed and much of the Patriarchate destroyed.

NEW YORK -- A bomb was thrown into the compound of the Ecumenical Patriarchate and exploded on the

Rogue Group of Retired Turkish Officers Planning Assassination of His All							
Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew							
7/26/07							
http://www.archons.org/news/detail.asp?id=169							
A network of Turkish retired officers was planning even the murder of Ecumenical Patriarch Vartholomew according to							
investigations conducted by Turkish judicial authorities. The network was dismantled last month when weapons and							
explosives were found near in a hovel near Konstantinopolis. ""Aksam"" newspaper says that evidence on the planning of							
Ecumenical Patriarch Vartholomew assassination was found in the hard disc of the ""National Forces Union"" president							
Bekir Ozturk. The same organization seems to have been planning assassinations of the Armenian Patriarch and Jewish							
businessman	 Isaac Alaton	 whose partner Gary was murdered under unknown conditions.					
Bekir Ozturk was arrested within the framework of interrogations about the organization of retired officers who							
possessed an arsenal of grenades	 bombs and other weapons taken from the army. The network of retired officers was						
cooperating with the nationalist organization "" Movement of Patriotic forces and other 4 organizations. The organization							
was founded on December	27	 2006 and has 105 offices in 40 districts and 600.000 members.					
The ecumenical Patriarchate has in the past experienced grenade attacks	 claimed by an organization called IBDA						
believed to be of Islamic roots. However	 grenades and explosives used in the attacks came from military warehouses						
and in some cases their serial numbers were recognized by NATO procedures.							
According to ""Aksam"" newspaper judicial authorities have called security authorities and intelligence services to							
strengthen security of the Ecumenical Patriarchate	 the Armenian Patriarch and Isaac Alaton.						
A Plethora of Organized Efforts to Kill Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew							
and Other Christians							
TURKEY: Turkish nationalism	 Ergenekon	 and denial of religious freedom					
By Dr. Otmar Oehring	 Head of the Human Rights Office of Missio						
Article published October 21	2008						
A trial has begun in Turkey of influential people alleged to be part of an ultra-nationalist group	 Ergenekon. Otmar						
Oehring of the German Catholic charity Missio notes	 in a commentary for Forum 18 News Service	 that opposition to					
religious freedom is widespread. Ergenekon members are alleged to have maintained deathlists of people	 including						
Christians with a missionary background. The Malatya murder trial is revealing plausible links between Ergenekon	 the						
deep state"" and the murders. But local officials — who are almost certainly not in an Ergenekon-type group are also							
hostile to religious freedom. The Ergenekon case is part of a power-struggle between the ""deep state"" and the AKP							
government	 but it is unclear whether the current trials will advance freedom of religion and belief. Given the threats to

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766344 Date: 07/31/2015							
the day-to-day security and religious freedom of non-nationalist Turks	 whether the government effectively addresses						
the roots of these threats will be crucial.							
A court case in Turkey has pointed to the existence of a secretive underground ultra-nationalist organisation Ergenekon							
though this might merely be another name for the ""deep state"". The trial began near Istanbul on 20 October of 86							
alleged members -- from the police	 army	 business	 politics and the mass media - on charges that they were plotting to				
overthrow the current Justice and Development Party (AKP) government by 2009.							
The ""deep state"" is the term used in Turkey for nationalist circles in the army	 police	 National Intelligence Organisation					
(MIT) secret police and state administration	 which regard themselves as the custodians of the secularist legacy of the						
Republic's founder	 Mustafa Kemal Ataturk (see Fl8News 28 June 2007). The MIT closely monitors religious minorities						
and some MIT officers do indeed believe in protecting religious minorities. But other MIT officers are staunch							
nationalists and fully part of the ""deep state"" (see F18News 10 July 2007).							
Opposition to religious freedom is widespread among the ""deep state"" and wider sections of political life and the							
general public. This hostility has resulted in deaths and violent attacks	 and has not been effectively addressed by the						
government (see Fl8News 15 April 2008).							
The anti-religious minority views of ultra-nationalist circles and the ""deep state"" were no secret	 especially to the						
religious minorities themselves. But reports in the Turkish media about Ergenekon have	 perhaps for the first time	 given					
the wider Turkish public the details of the conspiracies. Many Turkish analysts think that the allegations made so far will							
turn out to be true.							
Members of Ergenekon are alleged to have maintained lists of people -- including Christians with a missionary							
background - targeted for killing. The involvement of Ergenekon has been alleged in the murders of Catholic priest Fr							
Andrea Santoro in Trabzon in February 2006 and three Protestants - Necati Aydin	 Tillman Geske and Ugur YA%ksel - in						
Malatya in April 2007. The MIT secret police is known to have maintained observation of the places where all four of							
these Christians were killed (see F18News 10 July 2007).							
The trial of those accused of the Malatya murders is revealing that there may be links between Ergenekon	 the ""deep						
state"" and the murders. As Christian news service Compass Direct reported on 21 October	 the lawyer Orhan Kemal						
Cengiz	 who leads the legal team representing the victims' families	 states that there is a ""very dark	 complex				
sophisticated web of relations behind the scenes.""							
Indeed	 the Ergenekon people not only seem to be the masterminds of the Santoro and Malatya murders (and of the						
murder of ethnic Armenian journalist Hrant Dink)	 they even had a plan to kill the Ecumenical Patriarch -- or at least to						
incite his murder in a way that could not be traced back to them.							
Among those arrested in the investigation against Ergenekon was ultranationalist lawyer Kemal Kerincsiz. As well as							
filing complaints against numerous writers for ""insulting Turkishness"" under the notorious Article 301 of the Penal Code							
he also brought a high-profile case of ""insulting Islam"" under the same Article against Hakan Tastan and Turan Topal							
Turks who joined a Protestant church.							
Even the so-called Turkish Orthodox Church -- which has almost no followers and was apparently designed by its							
founders as an irritant to the Greek Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarchate -- is revealed to have been closely linked with							
such circles. This ""church"" has been publicly supportive of Kerincsiz's claims that Turkish Christians ""insult Turkishness"".

Ergenekon is said to have used ""Turkish Orthodox Church"" buildings	 and to be closely liked with those who run this						
church"".							
Ergenekon-style nationalists are certain that almost everyone is against the Turks and Turkishness. Particular enemies of							
Turkey are thought by these circles to be all of Turkey's ethnic minorities	 particularly Kurds (some of whom are Alevi						
Muslims)	 as well as non-Muslim minorities. These views have long been widespread even outside Ergenekon-type						
circles (see F18News 29 November 2007).							
Ergenekon-type circles collected information on groups within these populations -- it helped that they had close ties to							
authorities with access to the personal data registry which records individuals' ethnic and religious affiliation. It is not							
known if Ergenekon itself -- if it existed in the form that is claimed - sent spies into religious minority communities.							
However	 all religious minorities -- especially Christians -- have long had unknown people visiting their services.						
Sometimes these visitors say they are there from the MIT secret police to ""protect"" them	 though more often they						
refuse to explain who they are (see F18News 26 July 2006).							
Religious minorities doubt whether the police or MIT secret police would really attend their places of worship to protect							
them: they are more likely to believe they are there to listen	 watch and take notes. Even this year in 2008	 believers					
leaving services are asked who they are and why they have attended. The authorities want to know whether those							
attending Christian churches are foreigners	 local ""foreigners"" or possible converts. Ergenekon could have played a part						
in such enquiries.							
Many religious leaders have long been under surveillance by the MIT secret police. ""Walls have ears	 is the constant						
refrain in religious minority headquarters. Particularly close tabs were kept on Armenian Patriarch Mesrop Mutafyan							
who had two ""bodyguards"" from the secret police with him constantly.							
Again it remains unclear if this surveillance is to protect them or to keep tabs on all their activity. That a grenade could							
have been thrown into Patriarch Bartholomew's office from a small street outside the Ecumenical Patriarchate in							
Istanbul's Fener district - which is under full and very visible police surveillance - shows that any ""protection"" is at best							
ineffectual. Those charged with protecting religious leaders have not managed to stop threats against them.							
Religious minority leaders live with threats constantly	 whether through the media or directly. Patriarch Mesrop would						
receive about 300 emailed threats each day -- whether from one individual or many is unknown. Unknown people watch							
religious minority buildings	 making sure they are seen and noticed by the religious minorities.						
Perhaps the biggest impact so far of this constant atmosphere of threats is on the Armenian Apostolic Patriarchate							
Turkey's biggest Christian denomination. Mesrop Mutafyan	 who was elected Patriarch in 1998 against the express						
wishes of the Turkish authorities	 has been forced to retreat into health-related seclusion. Many believe the severe						
health problems he is suffering -- which have affected him both physically and mentally - are akin to post-traumatic							
stress disorder. They believe these have been brought on by years of pressure from the media	 the public and from the						
Armenian diaspora	 some of which has dubbed him a traitor. As well as opposing his original election	 the Turkish					
authorities also made trouble for him over the restoration of the Patriarchate several years ago.							
Should Patriarch Mesrop not recover and be in a position to take up his functions again	 this could threaten the future of						
the Armenian Church in Turkey. The Turkish authorities are likely to insist -- as they have done up to now -- that the							
head of the Armenian (as well as the Greek Orthodox) Patriarchate must be a Turkish citizen resident in Turkey. The

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766344 Date: 07/31/2015							
Armenian Church may struggle to find a candidate with the diplomatic and linguistic skills and the international							
experience for such a crucial role in such a delicate and exposed position. This problem is of importance not just for the							
Church but for the Armenian community as a whole.							
However	 it is clear that Ergenekon and the ""deep state"" are not the only obstacle for freedom of religion or belief. Local						
officials -- who are almost certainly not in an Ergenekon-type organisation continue to obstruct the work of non-							
Muslim communities. This can clearly be seen when it comes to property disputes.							
Roman Catholics	 for example	 face several difficult property battles	 most notably in the southern coastal city of Mersin				
where they have a large compound which they have used since Ottoman times. The only document the Catholics have							
confirming their ownership is a firman (decree) issued by the Ottoman sultan	 which the local authorities do not						
consider is valid. Successive court cases brought by the local authorities in the 1980s finally reached Turkey's Supreme							
Court in Ankara in the 1990s	 which ruled in favour of the Catholics.						
Such ownership problems are faced by all the minorities	 despite their widely differing legal status. As is the case with all						
non-Muslim minority groups	 Catholics do not legally exist. Furthermore	 as their properties are not organised as					
community foundations""	 their properties have no legal personality on their own. And as the Catholics do not legally						
exist	 the government at times argues that they therefore also cannot have property. This shows that despite						
government claims	 these property problems have not been resolved by the latest Foundations Law (see F18News 13						
March 2008).							
In the case of the Catholics of Mersin	 the local authorities re-started the dispute through the courts	 in a case that is					
now pending at the High Court. Catholics fear a negative ruling	 which would force them to take their case to the						
European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg. This would be extremely expensive and time-consuming	 even						
though this may turn out to be the only effective way for religious minorities to secure freedom of religion or belief (see							
F18News 18 January 2007).							
The authorities in Mersin argue that the Ottoman firman only allows Catholic people to construct a specific building (a							
church) and did not grant them ownership of the land on which it was built. Similar court cases were brought in the past							
over the Assumptionist Church in Kadikoy	 Istanbul (ECHR case No. 26308/95).						
The Mersin authorities' desire to confiscate Catholic property would leave the community with nowhere to worship							
though it remains unclear how far the authorities would go. They could take away legal ownership	 while allowing the						
Catholics to continue to use the church. In the past	 authorities elsewhere have used such methods to confiscate						
religious property ""legally"".							
Another example is in Adana. The town's Jesuit-run. Catholic church has long faced harassment from local people							
attending a nearby wedding hall	 which was built close to it in defiance of regulations. The mayor's office has said that						
the wedding hall should be closed but has taken no action to enforce this.							
Ancient cemeteries where Christians are buried -- such as in Samsun — or Christian sections of bigger cemeteries -- as in							
Ankara - are also not being protected from vandalism	 despite requests from the Christian Churches. In the Black Sea						
port of Trabzon -- where Fr Santoro was murdered - the Christian cemetery is threatened with confiscation. Muslim							
cemeteries face no such problems.							
By contrast	 spokespersons for the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate have pointed to two positive developments. They

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766344 Date: 07/31/2015							
welcomed the January 2008 statement in parliament by the Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan that the issue of							
whether its Patriarch	 Bartholomew	 is ""Ecumenical"" or not is an ""internal"" matter for the Patriarchate and that the state					
should not interfere. Previously the authorities have responded ferociously to any claims that Bartholomew's religious							
role extends beyond Istanbul's tiny surviving Greek Orthodox community.							
Greek Orthodox spokespersons also welcome the July 2008 ruling by the ECHR in Strasbourg over the Buyukada							
orphanage	 particularly the finding that not only does the property belong to the Orthodox Patriarchate but that the						
Patriarchate is an existing legal person (application no. 14340/05).							
Erdogan's statement about the title ""Ecumenical"" is likely to have little immediate impact on the general public	 which						
continues to regard the Patriarchate with suspicion or hostility. The ECHR ruling should have an impact on other							
religious communities which have so far struggled to assert their right to a legal existence.							
Meanwhile a new party	 the Law and Equality Party (Hak ve Esitlik Partisi)	 was created on 4 September to promote a					
nationalist agenda. The party	 founded by a former general prominent in the war against the PKK Kurdish rebels	 is also					
aimed at getting rid of Christians and ending Christian proselytism. The first sentence of the call to found the party--							
published as a full-page advertisement in many newspapers - attacks what it calls the ""colonisation"" of Turkey by							
missionaries	 presumably Christian. ""Turkish nation -- we know that you are fed up that your democracy is treated like a						
child	 that foreign representatives and missionaries run around on our soil and boss you around	 it reads.					
Although the party seems to be well-organised in Turkey's provinces	 it remains unclear how serious it is and how many						
votes it might be able to gather in an election. Nevertheless	 the party reflects more widely-held chauvinist views	 which					
see no place in Turkey for non-Muslim minorities (see F18News 29 November 2007).							
Public opinion in Turkey is becoming more hostile to freedom of religion or belief	 and increasingly favours extreme						
nationalism of the Ergenekon kind. The government's actions are favourable to these kinds of views -- even if not to the							
Ergenekon group itself -- and it does not seem to want to act effectively to protect non-nationalist Turkish citizens. The							
ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) is not itself an extreme nationalist party	 but it could do much more to make						
it unambiguously clear that religious and ethnic minorities are Turkish citizens with equal rights.							
The AKP itself is under threat from Ergenekon-style views; indeed	 those associated with the ""deep state"" recently tried						
to have the AKP banned. A fight is underway between the Army and the old Kemalist ""deep state"" on one side and the							
AKP on the other. But it is not at all clear that the AKP is necessarily in this fight to advance democratic values	 including						
freedom of religion and belief.							
It also remains unclear whether the AKP will prevail. Visits by members of the General Staff to Ergenekon prisoners							
ahead of the trial have been interpreted as a warning to the AKP not to go too far.							
The court case against alleged key leaders and members of Ergenekon is merely the latest step in the power-struggle							
between the ""deep state"" (of which Ergenekon appears to have been a part) and the AKP. That the judiciary -- quite							
obviously pushed by the government -- has initiated the court case can be seen as proof that the AKP government is							
fighting back against those groups in society and state that are striving to drive the AKP from power.							
Whether the Ergenekon court case will prove to be a step towards real democracy in Turkey -- leading to improvements							
in the area of freedom of religion and belief -- is quite another question. It is not only the court cases on Ergenekon and							
the Malatya murders which will decide this. Given the undeniable threats to the day-to-day security and religious

will be crucial in deciding this question.							
Continued Intimidation and Harassment by Istanbul Official Targeting							
Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew							
8/24/05							
http://www.archons.org/news/detail.asp?id=83							
ANKARA - The Greek Orthodox faithful in Turkey have 79 churches	 72 of them in Istanbul	 reported					
Interior Minister Abdulkadir Aksu yesterday.							
Aksu (pictured right) supplied the figures in response to Motherland Party (ANAVATAN) Istanbul Deputy							
Emin Sirin (pictured left)	 who	 dissatisfied with a previous question on why the the activities of Fener					
Greek Orthodox Patriarch Bartholomeos aren't scrutinized under the Treaty of Lausanne	 sent another						
motion to the Interior Ministry under right to information laws.							
Sirin stressed that the patriarch has attended religious ceremonies	 opened churches with religious						
ceremonies	 participated in visits	 receptions	 celebrations	 funerals	 and religious tourism activities so far		
in Yalvac	 Isparta	 Avanos	 Zelve	 and Urgup in Nevsehir	 Silivri in Istanbul	 and Selcuk in Izmir.	
In reply to Sirin's motion	 Aksu explained that the Culture and Tourism approves the patriarch's						
movements related to religious tourism and religious ceremonies and the relevant governors' offices refer							
the matter to the General Directorate of Security. He added that the necessary measures are taken.

Explosive device at Patriarchate an armed hand-grenade	 Turkish police say						
ANKARA (ANA - A. Abatzis) The explosive device found in the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Fanar and							
neutralised by a Turkish bomb squad earlier on Saturday was an armed hand-grenade	 Turkish police reported.						
According to an ANA correspondent in Ankara	 the unexploded grenade was spotted on the roof of St. George's						
Church within the Patriarchate grounds by a crew of window-cleaners.							
Turkish police said the grenade may have been thrown any time in the past month but went unnoticed because it							
did not explode.							
The Ecumenical Patriarchate has been the target of similar attacks several times in the past	 with grenades						
lobbed from the area behind the grounds and always landing near the same spot on the roof of the church. Past							
attacks have been accompanied by explosions.							
Commenting from Athens	 Greek foreign ministry spokesman George Koumoutsakos unequivocally						
condemned the incident and said that Greek diplomatic and consular authorities in Ankara and Istanbul had

Explosion Damages Istanbul Cathedral							
An explosion shattered windows at the seat of the spiritual leader of the world's Orthodox Christians in Istanbul							
on Thursday	 officials said. There were no reports of injuries.						
The blast struck the roof of the Cathedral of St. George	 shattering windows there as well as in the main						
building of the Ecumenical Patriarchate complex	 a Patriarchate official said on condition of anonymity.						
A terrorism police squad was investigating the cause of the blast	 police officials said.						
The blast came weeks after police clashed with hundreds of rock-throwing nationalist Turks who staged a							
protest outside the Patriarchate and burned an effigy of Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I	 whom far-right						
groups accuse of working against Turkish interests.							
Archbishop Demetrios Condemns Hostile Demonstrations Against Our Ecumenical							
Patriarchate							
10/30/05							
http://www.archons.org/news/detail.asp?id=104							
NEW YORK - Archbishop Demetrios of America has expressed his deepest sorrow and his strong and							
unequivocal condemnation for the most recent hostile demonstrations and threats against the holy center of							
world Orthodoxy	 the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople	 in Istanbul	 Turkey.				
This latest assault took place last Thursday	 October 28	 when groups of Turkish nationalists and other extreme					
elements demonstrated in Phanar against the Ecumenical Patriarchate chanting slogans such as ""one night we'll							
come to the Phanar	 ""go away Patriarch	 ""Patriarch don't test our patience	 ""take the Patriarchate and go to				
Greece	 and the like. Before police intervened	 the angry demonstrators reached the entrance to the Patriarchal					
compound	 and placed a black wreath in front of the gate.						
Archbishop Demetrios in his statement of condemnation said	 ""I express my deepest sorrow for the events that						
transpired outside of our Ecumenical Patriarchate last Thursday. The actions of these Turkish extremists-							
nationalists are appalling and condemnable in and by any civilized country. These are actions against a holy							
institution which survived and lives on through the centuries. It's an institution highly respected by the entire							
civilized world. These demonstrators are short changing themselves and Turkey	 as they paint a picture of						
uncivilized	 petty	 narrow-minded people.""					
As a Church and as Orthodox in America	 we are in spirit and in prayer by the side of our Ecumenical						
Patriarchate	 and we stand in full support with love and care towards our Mother Church as we are reassured						
that He Who has many times saved this Patriarchate and has protected it in difficult times will once again be

next to our Ecumenical Patriarch and the Fathers of the Great Church of Christ and He will lead this crisis to a							
favorable result according to the teachings of our Lord	 that God	 'will not break a bruised reed	 and smoking				
flax He will not quench	 till He sends forth justice to victory' (Matt. 12:20).""						
Serbian Orthodox Church Expresses Concern Over Activities of Extremist Groups in Turkey Against							
Ecumenical Patriarchate							
11/7/05							
http://www.archons.org/news/detail.asp?id=106							
Solidarity with Patriarchate of Constantinople							
The Assembly is also disturbed by frequent libelous assaults against certain institutions of the Serbian Orthodox							
Church	 which are groundlessly and irresponsibly accused of hiding persons indicted for war crimes. The						
members of the Assembly reacted similarly to the slander and attacks by extremist groups in Turkey against the							
Patriarchate of Constantinople and His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I. The Assembly							
firmly hopes that the state institutions of the Republic of Turkey	 clearly oriented toward a European future	 will					
offer adequate protection and legal security to the Orthodox Church	 other Christian churches	 and all minority					
communities on its territory.							
OFFICIAL STATEMENT							
BY HIS EMINENCE ARCHBISHOP SPYRIDON							
GREEK ORTHODOX ARCHDIOCESE OF AMERICA							
http://www.goarch.ordnews/goa.news660							
His Eminence Archbishop Spyridon of America strongly condemned this latest criminal act of the bombing of the							
Ecumenical Patriarchate headquarters in Istanbul	 Turkey	 on December 3	1997				
Upon reflecting on this act of terror	 the serious wounding of a clergyman	 and the destruction of property of the					
Ecumenical Patriarchate	 His Eminence said:						
Six weeks after he received the Congressional Gold Medal	 the Ecumenical Patriarch was threatened by a bomb blast						
directed at him and his Church. This is unacceptable.							
At the dawn of the 21st century	 it is inconceivable that the basic human rights	 such as the freedom of worship	 the				
ability to live a peaceful life according to the law of one's country	 and the freedom to live without the constant fear of						
having ones life and property destroyed without cause	 are still abused and denied in countries such as Turkey.						
How can a person claim for himself to be civilized	 to be peace-loving	 to be respectful of human rights and to be treated					
as part of the civilized world when his own actions violate these universally accepted tenets of humanity.							
I condemn all violence and persecution of human beings everywhere	 for every person is gifted by God with dignity						
honor	 and the right to live a peaceful life.						
It is the responsibility of the Government of Turkey to provide safety and security for all of her citizens	 and to seriously						
obey the international rules which govern a civilized society.

5. The State Department should consider whether the security of an embassy in a combat zone is						
an inherently governmental function	 and therefore not subject to contracting out. The language					
in the 2009 National Defense Authorization Act could be strengthened to prohibit the reliance on						
private security contractors for inherently governmental functions	 and to include protection of					
the diplomatic mission in a combat zone as being inherently governmental. If embassy security						
in combat zones is determined not to be an inherently governmental function	 the State					
Department should consider requiring military supervision of its private security contractors						
guarding U.S. embassies in combat zones.

1 (1) The separate account created by Congress

5 tool to ensure transparency of administrative costs

9 Agency's program funding and the expanded .geo-							
10 graphic and sectoral demands for economic assist-

12 (3) As a result	 this has caused the Agency in						
13 certain cases to fund selected administrative costs							
14 out of program funds in order to properly admin-

19 tended to foster.							
20 (4) A 2003 Government Accountability Office							
21 report on the operating expenses of the Agency _							
22 noted that ""USAID's operating expense account

world view	 who has to enforce						
a new set of guidelines and policies							
by leading the same agency and the same							
people as in the past.""							
Several of Panetta's top deputies worked							
closely with George Tenet	 the agency's						
director from 1997 until 2004. Under							
Tenet	 the C.I.A. took the lead role in						
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015							

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015							
fighting terrorism	 and its officers became						
the jailers	 and sometimes the tormentors						
of many U.S.-held detainees. Tenet	 who						
is now a managing director of the investment							
bank Allen & Company	 has all but						
disappeared from public sight in Washington.							
He recently cancelled an appearance							
scheduled at the Panetta Institute this							
month. (""George has not wanted to do							
stuff in front of a camera	 Panetta noted.)						
But in his 2007 memoir	 ""At the Center of						
the Storm	 Tenet defended the use of						
enhanced"" interrogation techniques on							
terror suspects	 claiming that the information						
they elicited had prevented other attacks							
and saved American lives. (He also							
assured President Bush that the case for							
going to war in Iraq was ""a slam dunk."")							
But a former senior agency official who							
worked with many of Tenet's top team							
members says	 ""These people carried out						
this policy. . . but they'll muddy the waters							
by explaining why what they did was O.K.							
They will say that 'Bush was bad' but they							
weren't. A lot of it is just to protect their							
own positions. It's amazing to me that all							
these Tenet people survived!""							
Behind Panetta's desk—next to a							
framed	 tattered American flag that was						
rescued from the ruins of the World							
Trade Center—is a door leading to the							
office of Stephen Kappes	 whom Panetta						
has kept on as the agency's second-incommand.							
Kappes	 a former U.S. marine						
is widely admired within the agency	 in						
particular for his role in persuading the							
Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi to							
abandon his nuclear-weapons program	 in						
2003. ""Kappes is the case officer's case							
officer	 John Radsan	 who was a lawyer at					
the C.LA. during President Bush's first							
term	 says. Intense	 serious	 and fluent in				
Russian and Farsi	 Kappes has served as a						
station chief in Moscow	 New Delhi	 and					
Frankfurt	 and has supervised many clandestine						
operations. In April	 President						
Obama paid a visit to C.I.A. headquar-							
ters and singled out Kappes as the wise							
graybeard"" in the building. Senator Fein-							
stein insisted to Obama Administration							
officials privately that Kappes continue as							
deputy director; it was a condition of her							
support for Panetta	 whose lack of experience						
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015							

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015							
in covert operations she questioned.							
During the first term of the Bush Administration							
Kappes was a top official							
in the Directorate of Operations. This							
group oversaw the agency's Counterterrorist							
Center	 which	 in turn	 managed				
the secret detention-and-interrogation							
program. Few doubt that he was aware							
that the C.I.A. was engaging in brutality.							
One former officer recalls that Kappes							
voiced qualms	 warning that the program						
amounted to ""torture."" According to the							
former officer	 once Kappes was overruled						
he went along; Kappes was ""the brains"" of							
the directorate	 the former officer says.						
(Kappes	 through a spokesman	 denied					
having had a direct role in the interrogation							
program	 or having called its tactics						
torture.) Another former C.I.A. operative							
says	 ""It would be hard to say someone so						
involved could be robustly objective"" in							
advising Panetta.							
Panetta says that most of the individuals							
who managed the secret interrogation							
program have since left the agency. One of							
the holdovers is Jonathan Fredman	 who						
was formerly the chief counsel to the division							
that ran the interrogation program;							
he is now on temporary assignment with							
the director of National Intelligence. According							
to notes from a 2002 meeting							
which were disclosed at a recent Senate							
hearing	 Fredman advised that torture ""is						
basically subject to perception. If the detainee							
dies	 you're doing it wrong."" The						
notes	 whose accuracy Fredman has disputed						
describe him saying that videotapes							
of interrogations would look ""ugly."" Fredman's							
former boss is John A. Rizzo	 the						
C.I.A.'s acting general counsel	 who						
was the recipient of many of the Justice							
Department's torture memos. (Rizzo is							
scheduled to leave the agency once a replacement							
has been confirmed.) And the							
current head of the Counterterrorist Center—							
the officer	 who is undercover	 cannot					
be identified—ran the interrogation							
program for part of Bush's second term.							
Several current station chiefs and division							
chiefs were also deeply involved in brutal							
interrogations	 as were pilots	 logistical experts					
medical personnel	 and others.						
Meanwhile	 John Brennan—the man						
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015							

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015							
who was considered too politically toxic for							
the top C.I.A. job—has become a senior							
official on the National Security Council.							
Brennan	 who	 as one former C.I.A. officer					
puts it	 was once ""joined to George Tenet						
at the hip""—he served as Tenet's chief of							
staff—now advises Obama on terrorism							
and other national-security issues. He has •							
reportedly lobbied hard to maintain secrecy							
on past abuses. According to Newsweek							
Brennan recently persuaded Panetta							
to join him in protesting Obama's plan to							
release four shocking Justice Department							
memos about the interrogation program.							
The documents	 written by lawyers in the						
Office of Legal Counsel	 showed that the						
C.I.A. had waterboarded one suspect at							
least a hundred and eighty-three times and							
subjected many others to harrowing mistreatment.							
Opponents have argued that							
exposing such details could spark an anti-							
American backlash. Panetta also argued							
forcefully in favor of indemnifying any							
C.I.A. officers whose actions	 as described						
in the memos	 might have opened them						
up to criminal charges.							
Several well-respected former C.I.A.							
officials—including Fred Hitz	 a former						
inspector general	 and Paul Pillar	 a former					
Middle East analyst—told me that •							
they saw no harm in releasing the documents.							
Dennis C. Blair	 the director of						
National Intelligence	 who oversees the						
U.S. intelligence establishment	 including						
the C.I.A.	 also supported the release						
of the documents	 after his staff concluded						
that the disclosures would likely							
do no damage.							
After intense consideration	 and a latenight						
meeting in Rahm Emanuel's office							
Obama rejected Panetta's arguments for							
secrecy	 deciding that it was in the public						
interest to release the memos. But Obama							
also endorsed the notion of giving blanket							
amnesty to any C.I.A. officers performing							
authorized work.							
Panetta's resistance to public disclosure							
seemed out of character to some longtime							
colleagues. ""I was surprised by Leon's							
position on the O.L.C. memos	 Phil						
Trounstine told me. ""It's tough to maintain							
your principles when you're head of							
the C.I.A.	 because you need to be seen as						
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015							

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015							
someone that the people inside the agency							
want to follow."" Panetta had become an							
advocate for secrecy so quickly	 a White						
House official joked	 that ""it's like 'Invasion						
of the Body Snatchers.'""							
Panetta's advisers may have had a personal							
stake in opposing transparency. Another							
former C.I.A. official	 who knows						
Brennan well	 noted that	 if the Bush torture					
program were to be further investigated							
potentially	 both Brennan and						
Kappes could have a lot to lose."" Brennan's							
supporters have argued that he had no operational							
control over the interrogation							
program	 and point out that his tenure						
as Tenet's chief of staff ended in March							
2001	 before the Al Qaeda attacks. But he						
was subsequently named deputy executive							
director	 and served in that position until						
March	 2003—the period when the most						
brutal detainee treatment occurred. In addition							
Brennan often briefed President							
Bush about daily developments in the war							
on terror. Brennan has described himself							
as an internal critic of waterboarding—a							
position that friends	 such as Emile Nakhleh						
a former senior officer	 confirm. Yet						
in an interview with me two years ago							
Brennan defended the use of ""enhanced""							
interrogation techniques and extraordinary							
renditions							
in which the C.I.A. abducted							
terror suspects around the globe							
and transported them to other countries to							
be jailed and interrogated; many of those							
countries had execrable human-rights records.							
He also questioned some people's							
definition of ""torture."" ""I think it's torture							
when I have to ride in the car with my kids							
and they have loud rap music on	 he said.						
Asked if ""enhanced"" interrogation techniques							
were necessary to keep America							
safe	 he replied	 ""Would the U.S. be handicapped					
if the C.I.A. was not	 in fact	 able					
to carry out these types of detention and							
debriefing activities? I would say yes.""							
Anthony Lake	 who was the national-						
security adviser under Clinton							
said of Brennan	 ""I've known John a long						
time	 and he's a really good guy. I would						
argue	 you can't throw out the whole						
agency."" Lake	 in fact	 recommended					
Brennan to the Obama campaign when

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015							
it was looking for intelligence advisers—							
after consulting with their mutual friend							
George Tenet. America's intelligence							
community is an incestuous one	 making						
it difficult for a President to break							
with old ways of thinking.							
Indeed	 a well-informed analyst with						
close ties to the White House says that the							
C.I.A. has been lobbying hard to get							
Obama to support some form of preventive							
detention for terror suspects. An agency							
spokesman denies this. But the analyst							
56 THE NEW YORKER	 JUNE 22	2009					
says	 ""They definitely want the flexibility to						
hold people in some form of detention.							
They have been saying	 'We need deep						
authorities.' They've been presenting the							
President with nightmare scenarios.""							
Panetta	 for his part	 has been persuaded					
that renditions are a tool worth							
keeping. The rendition program began	 in						
a more carefully monitored form	 during						
the Clinton Administration	 but in the						
Bush years it was transformed into what							
John Radsan	 the former C.I.A. lawyer						
called ""an abomination."" As many as							
seven detainees were misidentified and							
abducted by mistake; many other suspects							
have alleged that they were hideously tortured							
by foreign governments. Panetta							
told me	 ""The worst part of rendition was						
rendition to a black site. That will not be							
the case anymore. If we render someone							
it will be to a country with jurisdiction							
over that individual."" During the Bush							
years	 however	 some of the most horrific					
allegations of abuse were made by detainees							
rendered not to black sites but to							
Egypt	 Syria	 and Morocco. The Obama					
Administration	 Panetta says	 will take					
precautions to insure that rendered suspects							
are treated humanely	 as the law requires.						
I've talked to the State Department							
and our people have to make very							
sure that people won't be mistreated	 Panetta						
said. ""Some places	 obviously	 it's					
more difficult to do. But we're going to							
have to press to make sure it doesn't happen							
because it would fly in the face of everything							
the President has said we stand							
for."" The Bush Administration professed							
to be taking similar precautions.							
The C.I.A. has apparently done nothing							
to penalize the officer who oversaw one

of the most notorious renditions—that of							
a German car salesman named Khaled el-							
Masri. He was abducted while on a holiday							
in Macedonia	 and flown by the agency						
to Afghanistan	 where he was detained in						
a dungeon for five months without charges							
before being released. From the start	 the						
rendition team suspected that his case was							
one of mistaken identity. But the C.I.A.							
officer in charge at Langley—the agency							
asked that the officer's name be withheld—							
insisted that Masri be further interrogated.							
She just looked in her crystal ball							
and it said that he was bad	 a colleague recalls.						
Masri says that he was chained in a							
freezing cell with no bed	 and given water						
so putrid that he could smell it across the							
room. He was threatened and stripped							
and could hear other detainees crying all							
around him. After several weeks	 the						
C.I.A. officer in charge learned that Masri's							
German passport was not a forgery	 as						
was originally suspected	 and that he was						
not the terror suspect the agency thought							
he was. (The names were similar.) Even so							
the officer in charge refused to release him.							
Eventually	 Masri went on a hunger strike						
losing sixty pounds. Skeptics in the agency							
went directly over the officer's head to							
Tenet	 who realized that his agency had						
been brutalizing an innocent man. Masri							
was released after a hundred and forty-nine							
days. But the officer in charge was not disciplined;							
in fact	 a former colleague says						
she's been promoted—twice."" Masri							
meanwhile	 has been unable to sue the						
U.S. government for either an apology or							
damages	 because the courts consider the						
very existence of rendition a state secret—							
a position that the Obama Justice Department							
has so far supported.							
No criminal charges have ever been							
brought against any C.I.A. officer involved							
in the torture program	 despite the						
fact that at least three prisoners interrogated							
by agency personnel died as the result							
of mistreatment. In the first case	 an						
unnamed detainee under C.I.A. supervision							
in Afghanistan froze to death after							
having been chained	 naked	 to a concrete					
floor overnight. The body was buried in							
an unmarked grave. In the second case	 an						
Iraqi prisoner named Manadel al-Jamadi

They do not bark.							
Do they know he is dead?							
They wag their tails

Their grief is colossal							
& forgetful.							
Each day they wake							
seeking his voice							
their names.							
By dusk they seem							
to unremember everything—							
to them even hunger							
is a game. For that	 I envy.						
For that	 I cannot bear to watch them						
pacing their cage. I try to remember							
they love best confined space							
to feel safe. Each day

I've begun to think of them							
as my father's other sons							
as kin. Brothers-in-paw.							
THE NEW YORKER	 JUNE 22	 2009 57					
interrogated by the C.I.A. at Abu Ghraib							
prison	 outside Baghdad. A forensic examiner						
found that he had essentially been							
crucified; he died from asphyxiation after							
having been hung by his arms	 in a hood						
and suffering broken ribs. Military pathologists							
classified the case a homicide.							
A third prisoner died after an interrogation							
in which a C.I.A. officer participated							
though the officer evidently did not cause							
the death. (Several other detainees have							
disappeared and remain unaccounted for							
according to Human Rights Watch.)							
During his tenure at the C.I.A.	 John						
Helgerson	 the former inspector general						
forwarded the crucifixion case	 along with						
an estimated half-dozen other incidents	 to						
the Justice Department	 for possible prosecution.						
But the case files have languished.							
An official familiar with the cases told me							
that the agency has deflected inquiries by							
the Senate Intelligence Committee seeking							
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015							

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015							
information about any internal disciplinary							
action. (Helgerson told me	 ""Some						
individuals have been disciplined. And							
others no longer work at the agency."")							
Panetta acknowledges that there are							
some people still at the C.I.A. who may be							
tainted by the torture program. Nevertheless							
he says	 ""I really respect the people						
who say we shouldn't have gotten involved							
in the interrogation business but we had to							
do our jobs. I don't think I should penalize							
people who were doing their duty. If							
you have a President who exercises bad							
judgment	 the C.I.A. pays the price.""						
On June 1st	 former Vice-President						
Cheney asserted in a speech that the							
C.I.A.	 rather than the White House	 first					
proposed hurting prisoners during interrogations.							
It was their initiative	 he said.						
They had a couple of cases where they							
thought enhanced interrogation techniques							
would provide information."" Panetta							
has a different view. ""There is no							
question in my mind	 he said. ""The interrogation						
thing	 to some extent	 was cast					
upon us	 because the military walked away						
from it	 and the F.B.I. walked away from						
it	 and so everybody came down on the						
C.I.A.	 he said. This is technically true	 although					
the F.B.I. ""walked away"" from interrogations							
of terrorism suspects after its							
director	 Bob Mueller	 heard complaints					
from an agent	 Ali Soufan	 that the C.I.A.'s					
interrogation methods amounted to ""borderline							
torture."" John Helgerson told me							
that he holds the the Pentagon							
and the White House equally responsible:							
They went arm in arm into it.""							
Without a thorough public investigation							
it's difficult to assess the truth behind							
such contradictory accusations. ""Everyone							
says	 'It's over	 it's known	' ""Nathaniel				
Raymond	 who works with the advocacy						
group Physicians for Human Rights	 told						
me. ""But what is known? We still don't							
know how many detainees were in the							
black sites	 or who they were. We don't						
fully know the White House's role	 or the						
C.I.A.'s role. We need a full accounting							
especially as it relates to health professionals.""							
The recently released Justice Department							
memos	 he noted	 contain numerous

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015							
references to C.I.A. medical personnel							
participating in coercive interrogation							
sessions. ""They were the designers	 the						
legitimizers	 and the implementers						
Raymond said. ""This is arguably the single							
greatest medical-ethics scandal in							
American history. We need answers.""							
Some conservatives are also calling for							
greater openness. Will Taft	 the general						
counsel to the State Department in the							
Bush Administration	 told me	 ""There are					
some twenty or thirty people whom the							
My eyes each day thaw.							
One day the water cuts off.							
Then back on.							
They are outside dogs—							
which is to say	 healthy						
& victorious	 purposeful						
& one giant muscle							
like the heart. Dad taught							
them not to bark	 to point						
out their prey. To stay.							
Were they there that day?							
They call me							
like witnesses & will not say.							
I ask for their care							
& their carelessness—							
wish of them forgiveness.							
I must give them away.							
I must find for them homes							
sleep restless in his.							
All night I expect they pace							
as I do	 each dog like an eye						
roaming with the dead							
beneath an unlocked lid.

C.I.A. said it formerly held but no longer							
does. Those names have never been released.							
The government should identify							
all the people in the program and account							
for them.""							
The Senate Intelligence Committee							
recently embarked on its own	 closed-door						
investigation of the torture program; Panetta							
told me that he has been assured that							
the committee members' work ""would be							
about lessons learned	 as opposed to going						
after people."" So the C.I.A. is ""cooperating							
with them	 giving them whatever information						
they need to try to conduct their							
review."" He says that the committee has							
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015							

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015							
already identified some ten million relevant							
documents. ""It's going to take a							
while	 he said.						
The Senate investigation will	 among						
other things	 probe the question of torture's						
efficacy. Dick Cheney has repeatedly							
claimed that ""enhanced"" interrogations							
yield results. Opponents say that torture is							
counterproductive. Panetta is more agnostic.							
He told me	 ""The bottom line would						
be this: Yes	 important information was						
gathered from these detainees. It provided							
information that in fact was acted upon.							
Was this the only way to obtain this information?							
I think that will always be an open							
question."" But he is certain that ""we did							
pay a price for using those methods.""							
A number of recently released documents							
call into question the notion that the							
C.I.A. played a passive role in relation to							
torture policy. A 2008 report by the Senate							
Armed Services Committee indicates							
that the agency hired contract psychologists							
who went on to design and implement							
specific forms of abuse—such as							
locking a detainee	 doubled up	 in a tiny					
airless cage—months before August	2002						
when the Justice Department granted legal							
authorization with its infamous ""torture							
memo."" More troublingly	 footnotes in the						
Office of Legal Counsel memos suggest							
that some C.I.A. interrogators may have							
egregiously exceeded the legal boundaries							
set down by the Justice Department and							
the White House—which seemingly puts							
them outside the legal safety zone demarcated							
by Obama and Panetta. In 2002	 the						
Bush Administration authorized interrogators							
to re-create the ostensibly safe waterboarding							
techniques used in military							
training. But	 instead of limiting the sessions						
to a maximum of two twenty-second							
bouts of controlled drowning	 as prescribed						
in military training	 the C.I.A. interrogators						
forced one detainee to undergo at least							
a hundred and eighty-three sessions	 and						
another at least eighty-three. And	 instead						
of using a very small amount of water	 as						
the Justice Department stipulated	 the						
C.I.A. interrogators subjected the detainees							
to ""large volumes"" of water. The memos							
quote Inspector General Helgersott's							
finding	 in his secret 2004 report on coercive						
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015							

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015							
techniques	 that the interrogators						
amplified the pain deliberately	 in order to						
make the sensation of drowning ""more							
poignant and convincing."" Helgerson also							
found that the psychologists and interrogators							
who designed the agency's protocols—							
and who claimed that their judgments							
were based on knowledge of military							
standards—had ""probably misrepresented""							
their ""expertise."" In addition	 the C.I.A.'s						
Office of Medical Services found that							
there was ""no reason to believe that applying							
the waterboard with the frequency and							
intensity with which it was used by the							
psychologist/interrogators . . was either							
efficacious or medically safe.""							
In April	 Panetta fired all the C.I.A.'s						
contract interrogators	 including the former						
military psychologists who appear to							
have designed the most brutal interrogation							
techniques: James Mitchell and							
Bruce Jessen. The two men	 who ran a						
consulting company	 Mitchell	 Jessen &					
Associates	 had recommended that interrogators						
apply to detainees theories of							
learned helplessness"" that were based on							
experiments with abused dogs. The firm's							
principals reportedly billed the agency a							
thousand dollars a day for their services.							
We saved some money in the deal	 too!""						
Panetta said. (Remarkably	 a month after						
Obama took office the C.I.A. had signed							
a fresh contract with the firm.)							
According to ProPublica	 the investigative						
reporting group	 Mitchell and Jessen's						
firm	 which in 2007 had a hundred						
and twenty people on its staff	 recently						
closed its offices	 in Spokane	 Washington.					
One employee was Deuce Martinez							
a former C.I.A. interrogator in the blacksite							
program; Joseph Matarazzo	 a former						
president of the American Psychological							
Association	 was on the company's board.						
(According to Kirk Hubbard	 the former						
head of the C.I.A.'s research and analysis							
I've put everything in your name in case my creditors come after me.""							
• •							
THE NEW YORKER	 JUNE 22	 2009 59					
division	 Matarazzo served on an agency						
professional-standards board during the							
time the interrogation program was set							
up	 but was not consulted about the						
interrogations.)

Lawsuits against abusive contractors							
remain a possibility	 and any one of them						
could expose a line of authorizations leading							
directly up the chain of command at							
the C.I.A.	 and into the Bush White						
House. George Brent Mickum IV	 a lawyer						
representing Abu Zubaydah	 a C.I.A.						
prisoner who was repeatedly waterboarded							
said	 ""I'd like to sue Mitchell and						
Jessen in a minute."" (Mitchell was an adviser							
on Zubaydah's interrogation.) After							
Zubaydah was waterboarded	 his lawyers						
say	 his mental state deteriorated	 and he					
has since been prescribed the antipsychotic							
drug Haldol.							
Few activists expect lawsuits against							
the C.I.A. or its contractors to succeed.							
But John Sifton	 an attorney who specializes						
in human-rights law	 and who is part						
of Zubaydah's legal team	 notes that there						
are other ways for the detainees' grievances							
to become public. ""The act of prosecuting							
the high-value detainees will be							
the accountability process	 Sifton said.						
It's impossible to try these detainees							
without allowing them to air all the information							
about their torture.""							
Other legal actions threaten to expose							
yet more secrets of the C.I.A.'s torture							
program. A prosecutor appointed by							
the Justice Department	 John Durham	 has					
convened a grand jury in Washington to							
weigh potential criminal charges against							
C.I.A. officers who were involved in							
the destruction of ninety-two videotapes							
documenting the interrogations of Abu							
Zubaydah and other detainees. Mickum							
told me that he has met several times with							
Durham	 and believes that the scope of his						
inquiry may have expanded to include a review							
of whether the C.I.A. began using							
brutal methods on Zubaydah before it received							
written authorization from the Justice							
Department. (This would provide an							
extra motive for destroying the videotapes.)							
Mickum said	 ""I got the sense he was very						
serious."" (Durham declined to comment.)							
The A.C.L.U.	 meanwhile	 is suing to get					
access to classified descriptions of what was							
on the destroyed videotapes. Last week							
Panetta filed an affidavit opposing the disclosure							
which he said ""could be expected							
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015							

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015							
to result in exceptionally gave damage to							
the national security."" Once again	 he was						
protecting Bush-era interrogation secrets.							
Pressure is also coming from abroad.							
In Italy	 two dozen C.I.A. officers are on						
trial in absentia for participating in a 2003							
rendition. Robert Seldon Lady	 the agency's						
station chief in Milan at the time	 can						
no longer travel to Italy without danger of							
arrest	 nor can the other C.I.A. officers						
named in the case. Spain has opened a							
criminal investigation of six Bush Administration							
officials in connection with torture.							
And in London a former rendition							
victim is suing the British authorities.							
After a British judge ruled that the							
plaintiff; Binyam Mohammed	 should be						
given access to C.I.A. intelligence documents							
that the agency shared with British							
authorities	 the Obama Administration						
surprised liberals by pressuring the British							
government to stop the disclosures.							
Several other legal challenges to the							
agency's interrogation program are working							
their way through the U.S. court system.							
A judge in California recently rejected							
the Justice Department's claims of							
blanket state secrecy in a case brought by							
five rendition victims against Jeppesen							
Dataplan	 a subsidiary of Boeing	 which					
provided the flight plans for the C.I.A.'s							
renditions. In a press conference in April							
Obama indicated that he had had second							
thoughts about the Justice Department's							
assertion of blanket state secrecy in the							
case	 but on June 12th the Administration						
reasserted its original claim.							
Earlier this month	 Philip Mudd						
Obama's nominee for a top Homeland							
Security post	 withdrew from consideration						
after it became clear that his Senate							
confirmation would turn into a fight over							
his previous role in the C.I.A.'s interrogation							
program. Rahm Emanuel	 speaking						
of the many challenges posed by the torture							
scandal	 told me	 ""It's a day-to-day—					
I won't say struggle—but problem. There							
are a lot of cases in the queue that require							
response. Many of them. But I've seen the							
President in the Situation Room	 and I						
know he wants to move forward.""							
Panetta is already forging ahead on one							
important reform: he plans to replace the							
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015							

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015							
abusive interrogation program with a legally							
acceptable	 non-coercive alternative.						
A task force led by the Harvard Law							
School professor Philip Heymann has							
been advising him on a proposal to create							
an elite U.S. government interrogation							
team	 staffed by some of the best C.I.A.						
F.B.I.	 and military officers in the country						
and drawing on the advice of social scientists							
linguists	 and other scholars. ""What						
I'm pushing for is to establish a facility							
where we develop a team of interrogators							
trained in the latest techniques	 Panetta						
said. ""That's the one thing I'm worried							
about	 frankly. There just aren't that many						
people who have the interrogation abilities							
we're going to need."" Heymann describes							
the effort to create ""the best non-coercive							
interrogation team in the world"" as the							
equivalent of ""a NASA-like	 man-on-themoon						
effort"" for human-intelligence gathering.							
He said that members of his task							
force have travelled to France	 England						
Japan	 Australia	 and Israel	 in order to				
compile comparative information on what							
interrogators do. ""We also went to the best							
people in the U.S.	 he added.						
Panetta has many ambitions for his tenure							
at the agency. He spoke to me of the							
need for the C.I.A. to increase its foreignlanguage							
skills	 and to recruit officers of						
more diverse backgrounds	 who can more						
easily infiltrate hostile parts of the world.							
But	 as Panetta sees it	 the C.I.A.'s effort to					
disrupt	 destroy	 and dismantle"" Al Qaeda					
remains its top priority. The agency continues							
to acquire intelligence suggesting							
that Al Qaeda is planning attacks on America							
he told me. ""We're conducting pretty							
robust operations in Pakistan	 and I think						
we're doing a good job of trying to disrupt							
Al Qaeda. But	 clearly	 that is a threat.""					
The greatest danger	 he said	 is that Al					
Qaeda will ""find other safe havens to go							
to	 in states such as Somalia and Yemen.						
Our mission is to make sure they can't find							
a place to hide."" Finding and bringing							
to justice Al Qaeda's leaders—in particular							
Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-							
Zawahiri—""remains							
a focal point	 Panetta						
said. ""It's not easy	 as you can imagine.""						
Last week	 the Times reported on escalating

friction over jurisdiction between							
Panetta and Dennis Blair	 the National						
Intelligence director. ""I'm surprised at							
the number of challenges you have to							
confront in this job	 Panetta confided.						
You're a traffic cop	 in many ways.""						
When he was the White House chief of							
staff	 Panetta said	 he could delegate the					
big decisions to the President. ""Here							
though	 he said	 gazing out over the					
C.I.A.'s serene grounds	 ""the decisions						
come to me. And a lot of them involve life							
and death."" Sometimes	 he added	 all					
he can do is ""say a lot of Hail Marys."" o							
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015												participation on our part	 as well as a commitment to paying our dues on time and in full.					
In all of these areas -- from Iraq and Afghanistan to the Balkans -- our objectives and						
investments are greatly enhanced when pursued in partnership with the international						
community. Many of our foreign policy challenges rely on coalitions of like-minded						
partners	 forged within our international institutions. And as demonstrated through our					
support for U.N. peacekeeping activities	 the dollars we contribute to these fora leverage					
significant returns.						
Therefore	 success lies in maintaining U.S. leadership in the international community.					
Responsible global leadership means meeting our financial commitments to international						
institutions	 even as we work with them to institute reforms to strengthen their efficacy.					
The Administration's budget requests $4.1 billion for assessed contributions to						
multilateral organizations and peacekeeping assessments	 demonstrating our resolve to					
work together with members of the international community in the pursuit of common						
goals. Our overall request meets U.S. financial commitments to the United Nations and						
other international organizations that support a wide range of U.S. national security						
foreign policy	 and economic goals	 including full funding of all 2010 scheduled				
payments to the Multilateral Development Banks	 and a portion of outstanding arrears.					
Fourth	 we must strengthen global security capabilities.					
One of the most basic responsibilities of government is to provide security and order to						
its people. Our allies and partners must be able to defend their territory and borders						
against both external and internal attacks. That is why our strategy seeks to forge						
partnerships among states to help build global security capacity in a host of areas						
including peacekeeping	 police training	 non-proliferation	 and combating nuclear			
terrorism. Notable examples include our Cooperative Threat Reduction Program with						
Russia; the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism	 which brings together 75					
10						
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05761340 Date: 06/30/2015						

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05761340 Date: 06/30/2015						
partner countries; and the Proliferation Security Initiative	 a global effort that aims to stop					
trafficking of weapons of mass destruction supported by over 90 countries.						
The FY 2010 request also includes $90 million to launch a new multi-year effort to help						
address the wide array of threats posed by terrorist organizations. The Shared Security						
Partnership will allow the United States to forge strategic partnerships with allies to						
confront common global extremist threats	 building on previous law enforcement and					
counter-terrorist efforts to create a regional and global information-sharing and						
coordination infrastructure.						
This budget also continues funding for the Global Peace Operations Initiative (GPOI)						
which builds and maintains the capacity and effectiveness of peace operations worldwide.						
GPOI is on track to complete its global target of training 75	000 peacekeepers	 and is				
shifting its focus from the direct training of peacekeepers to building sustainable						
indigenous capacity. Funding will also enhance the ability of our partners to address						
counterterrorism threats through the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership and the						
East Africa Regional Strategic Initiative programs; reform military forces in the						
aftermath of conflict into professional military forces with respect for the rule of law						
including those in Southern Sudan	 Liberia	 the Democratic Republic of the Congo	 and			
Somalia; and address critical regional coastal and border security problems in Africa.						
Finally	 our resource request for nonproliferation	 anti-terrorism	 and demining activities			
is up 17 percent	 including increases to expand the terrorist interdiction watchlist system					
and efforts to destroy conventional weapons stockpiles.						
Fifth	 we must maintain the resources to respond to urgent humanitarian needs.					
The U.S. remains the leader in responding to the most vulnerable populations	 providing					
basic life-sustaining support in the face of disasters; and protection of refugees	 conflict					
victims	 and internally displaced persons overseas. Our humanitarian assistance					
programs are the most fundamental expression of our values	 from responding to the					
devastating impacts of the cyclone in Burma to the victims of conflict and instability in						
Darfur	 Zimbabwe	 and now Sri Lanka and Pakistan. We have also seen that leading with				
these values has a multiplier effect. It was our humanitarian assistance in the aftermath						
of the earthquake in Pakistan that began to turn the sentiments of Pakistani citizens away						
from extremists	 and to see the United States as a force for good in their lives. And we					
know that the deep human suffering -- the lack of access to the most basic of needs -- can						
feed instability and further conflict.						
Our request aims to budget fully for expected requirements for refugees	 rather than					
continuing to rely on supplemental appropriations. The request includes $4.1 billion in						
refugee	 disaster	 displaced persons and emergency food assistance	 which is part of our			
comprehensive U.S. food security efforts. In addition to basic needs	 these resources					
assist refugees with voluntary repatriation	 local integration	 or permanent resettlement in				
a third country	 and provide critical humanitarian relief	 rehabilitation	 and reconstruction			
in countries around the world affected by natural and man-made disasters.

Conclusion: Managing for Success						
Securing the resources to promote our goals is an important step toward restoring						
American global leadership. But resources are not enough. With leadership comes						
responsibility	 and especially in these difficult economic times	 we must be better				
managers of our resources. Congress has been at the forefront of identifying ways to						
improve our assistance policies and practice	 and we thank you for your leadership and					
welcome your ongoing consultation.						
I hope that the simple fact that I am here before you today is a sign of our commitment to						
greater fiscal discipline and efficiency in international affairs. One of Secretary Clinton's						
first orders of business was to fill for the first time the position of Deputy Secretary of						
State for Management and Resources. This reflected her seriousness and determination						
that the Department must be a responsible steward of taxpayer dollars and maximize						
resources for greatest effect.						
Among my first duties has been to undertake a comprehensive review of our foreign						
assistance programs. Secretary Clinton has asked me to make recommendations on new						
ways to speed the cause of development in nations left behind by poverty	 to use foreign					
aid to buttress our foreign policy aims	 and to bring the full power of our resources to					
bear. This effort is well underway	 and we look forward to working with you as it					
evolves.						
At that same time	 we are already acting on some of the principles that will help guide					
our new approach to foreign assistance. We are learning from real-world experiences						
what works and what does not. We are also rethinking where to focus our attention to						
best advance our nation's security.						
In particular	 let me highlight the importance of an integrated approach to development to					
our efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan. To get our policies right toward these two						
critically important countries	 we must deploy our resources for maximum impact.					
Both the State Department and USAID are building upon the Administration's overall						
strategic review to craft and implement a comprehensive effort that focuses on ways that						
civilian agencies -- State	 USAID	 working together the Department of Agriculture and				
others -- can bolster both security and development. We recognize that over the long						
haul	 we will not have one without the other. Different agencies have different tools and					
different strengths. We are working to unite them behind a common mission.						
You can see a similar focus on unity of effort in an entirely different initiative -- the						
Administration's efforts to develop a new food security strategy to dramatically reduce						
global hunger and poverty. The State Department is leading a whole-of-government						
process to design and implement this new strategy. We are creating an inventory of each						
agency's programs	 identifying gaps in our current programming	 and coordinating				
among all agencies to develop a shared strategy.						
Both of these efforts underscore the need to develop basic mechanisms that allow us to						
integrate our strengths -- acting as a sort of diplomatic force multiplier under a shared

mission. State and USAID account for about 70 percent of official U.S. development						
assistance; we are just two of the nearly 20 U.S. agencies involved in providing foreign						
aid. We must care more about strategy	 unity and results than we do about turf. We must					
be able to look at a country	 a function	 or an objective	 and be able to identify everything			
that the US. government is doing in that area -- not just State. To meet the challenges of						
a world being bound closer together	 we need a government that is working closer					
together.						
Similarly	 we must speak with one voice. Our partners abroad have sometimes received					
mixed messages from the array of agencies working in international affairs	 each of					
which has its own rules of engagement. Our ability to get results on the ground will						
depend on our ability to field coordinated teams	 both in Washington and around the					
globe. This is why we are so urgently focused on better coordination of U.S. efforts in						
Afghanistan and Pakistan	 and it is why we are reviewing options about how best to					
develop systems and incentives to strengthen coordination across our foreign affairs						
programs.						
Let me also mention another key principle behind our reform efforts: accountability. We						
must demand results. That means defining specific strategic priorities; developing and						
validating ways to measure performance with OMB	 Congress	 and other key				
stakeholders; and making budget and program-management decisions on the basis of						
results -- or lack thereof.						
Finally	 we are mindful that in an age of economic crisis and foreign challenges	 the				
United States must be a more effective donor. Development progress is best achieved						
when priorities are determined and implemented by responsible partners	 and aid levels					
are sustained	 predictable	 and coordinated with other donors. We must continue to strive				
for our assistance to be demand-driven	 giving our people in the field the means to					
leverage opportunities and enhancing our ability to partner with responsible governments.						
This is an ambitious agenda	 but Secretary Clinton and I are looking forward to the					
challenges. With the right resources and your good counsel	 we are confident that we can					
rise to meet the moment. We look forward to consulting closely with the Congress and						
other stakeholders as we continue to move ahead in the coming weeks and months. And						
I look forward to our discussion today. Thank you again for having me here today	 and					
thank you for your time.

he audience that night to be our unofficial ambassadors	 to		
help build personal connections	 seek out partners in other countries. And I can report to you		
tonight they did not disappoint. In a few minutes	 you're going to meet some of these young		
leaders	 each with a powerful story to tell.		
The Generation Change network that started in this room now circles the globe. We are building			
an international alliance of young people who want to drive change in their own communities.			
They act as mentors	 spark respectful debates	 simply offer words of encouragement when	
needed. But most importantly	 they inspire others to keep expanding the circle of mutual		
understanding and respect	 one person at a time.

Even as we work to spread tolerance more broadly	 we also are working to deepen our		
appreciation for the experiences of others. Our 2012 Hours Against Hate initiative encourages			
young people to put themselves in another person's shoes through service projects. So far	 young		
people from all over the world have pledged thousands of volunteer hours to help people from a			
different background	 to see them as a fellow human being	 not a stereotype	 not a caricature
another real live person — people who don't look like you	 live like you	 pray like you	 but with
whom we will share this planet. And therefore	 we have work to do.		
People of faith and conscience are called to be the leaders of tolerance. In my tradition	 like all		
traditions	 we are expected to love one another. And together	 we have to translate that into better	
understanding and cooperation. I'm particularly pleased that the young people you will hear from			
tonight are really setting an example	 not only for young people elsewhere in the world but		
frankly	 for us who are older as well.		
Let me now call to the stage someone who has been a tremendous assistance to me in these			
efforts. Farah Pandith is the Department's first Special Representative to Muslim Communities.			
And from the beginning	 she has made reaching out to young people and civil society her top		
priority. Farah will introduce you to three young leaders who I am very proud of			
Remarks at the Transfer of Remains Ceremony to Honor Those Lost in Attacks in Benghazi	 Libya

Secretary Panetta	 Ambassador Rice	 Secretary Powell and Mrs. Powell	 family members of the
four patriots and heroes we bring home	 members of the State Department family	 ladies and	
gentlemen	 today we bring home four Americans who gave their lives for our country and our		
values. To the families of our fallen colleagues	 I offer our most heartfelt condolences and		
deepest gratitude.			
Sean Smith joined the State Department after six years in the Air Force. He was respected as an			
expert on technology by colleagues in Pretoria	 Baghdad	 Montreal	 and The Hague. He enrolled
in correspondence courses at Penn State and had high hopes for the future. Sean leaves behind a			
loving wife Heather	 two young children	 Samantha and Nathan	 and scores of grieving family
friends	 and colleagues. And that's just in this world. Because online in the virtual worlds that		
Sean helped create	 he is also being mourned by countless competitors	 collaborators	 and garners
who shared his passion.			
Tyrone Woods	 known to most as Rone	 spent two decades as a Navy SEAL	 serving multiple
tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. Since 2010	 he protected American diplomatic personnel in		
dangerous posts from Central America to the Middle East. He had the hands of a healer as well			
as the arms of a warrior	 earning distinction as a registered nurse and certified paramedic. Our		
hearts go out to Tyrone's wife Dorothy	 and his three sons Tyrone	 Jr.	 Hunter
a few months ago	 along with his grieving faii)ily	 friends	 and colleagues.

Glen Doherty	 who went by Bub	 was also a former SEAL and an experienced paramedic. He too	
died as he lived	 serving his country and protecting his colleagues. Glen deployed to some of the		
most dangerous places on Earth	 including Iraq and Afghanistan	 always putting his life on the	
line to safeguard other Americans. Our thoughts and prayers are with Glen's father Bernard	 his		
mother Barbara	 his brother Gregory	 his sister Kathleen	 and their grieving families
colleagues.			
I was honored to know Ambassador Chris Stevens. I want to thank his parents and siblings	 who		
are here today	 for sharing Chris with us and with our country. What a wonderful gift you gave		
us. Over his distinguished career in the Foreign Service	 Chris won friends for the United States		
in far-flung places. He made those people's hopes his own. During the revolution in Libya	 he		
risked his life to help protect the Libyan people from a tyrant	 and he gave his life helping them		
build a better country.			
People loved to work with Chris. And as he rose through the ranks	 they loved to work for Chris.		
He was known not only for his courage but for his smile — goofy but contagious — for his sense			
of fun and that California cool.			
In the days since the attack	 so many Libyans — including the Ambassador from Libya to the		
United States	 who is with us today — have expressed their sorrow and solidarity. One young		
woman	 her head covered and her eyes haunted with sadness	 held up a handwritten sign that said	
Thugs and killers don't represent Benghazi nor Islam	 The President of the Palestinian		
Authority	 who worked closely with Chris when he served in Jerusalem	 sent me a letter	
remembering his energy and integrity	 and deploring — and I quote — ""an act of ugly terror.""		
Many others from across the Middle East and North Africa have offered similar sentiments.			
This has been a difficult week for the State Department and for our country. We've seen the			
heavy assault on our post in Benghazi that took the lives of those brave men. We've seen rage			
and violence directed at American embassies over an awful interne video that we had nothing to			
do with. It is hard for the American people to make sense of that because it is senseless	 and it is		
totally unacceptable.			
The people of Egypt	 Libya	 Yemen	 and Tunisia did not trade the tyranny of a dictator for the
tyranny of a mob. Reasonable people and responsible leaders in these countries need to do			
everything they can to restore security and hold accountable those behind these violent acts. And			
we will	 under the President's leadership	 keep taking steps to protect our personnel around the	
world.			
There will be more difficult days ahead	 but it is important that we don't lose sight of the		
fundamental fact that America must keep leading the world. We owe it to those four men to			
continue the long	 hard work of diplomacy. I am enormously proud of the men and women of the		
State Department. I'm proud of all those across our government	 civilian and military alike	 who

represent America abroad. They help make the United States the greatest force for peace

So we will wipe away our tears	 stiffen our spines	 and face the future undaunted. And we will	
do it together	 protecting and helping one another	 just like Sean	 Tyrone
did. May God bless them and grant their families peace and solace	 and may God continue to		
bless the United States of America.			
And now	 let me have the great honor of introducing someone who came to the State Department		
earlier this week to grieve with us. He well understands and values the work that these men were			
doing for our country. The President of the United States.			
Remarks With Mexican Secretary of Foreign Relations Patricia Espinosa After Their			
Meeting			
18-Sep	2012		
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good afternoon	 everyone. And it is such a pleasure for me to		
welcome my friend and colleague	 Secretary Espinosa	 along with a very distinguished	
delegation of officials from the Mexican Government for this continuation of consultation at the			
highest levels of each of our governments.			
Before I turn to the matters discussed today	 let me give a brief update on the ongoing U.S.		
response to the protests in the Middle East and elsewhere. I'm sure as you know already	 we are		
taking aggressive steps to protect our staffs in embassies and consulates worldwide. That			
includes reviewing our security posture at every post and augmenting it where necessary. And			
we are working closely with the Libyan Government in our efforts to bring to justice those who			
murdered our four American colleagues in Benghazi.			
The FBI is now in Tripoli to join the investigation with Libyan officials	 and there is nothing		
more important to us than ensuring the safety of our American representatives worldwide. At the			
same time	 as I have said to State Department employees	 the incidents of the past week highlight	
how important our work is. The United States must and will remain strongly engaged in the			
world. Our men and women risk their lives in service to our country and our values	 because they		
know that the United States must be a force for peace and progress. That is worth striving and			
sacrificing for	 and nothing that happened last week changes this fundamental fact.		
Now	 turning to our friends and partners in Mexico	 we are always pleased to have a chance to	
discuss matters of mutual interest and concern between us. Mexico is one of our closest friends			
as well as partner on dozens of critical issues. So we talk about every kind of issue you can			
imagine	 from education and healthcare to poverty alleviation to the environment. But today	 we	
focused on a top priority for us both a security.

We just co-chaired the fourth meeting of the U.S.-Mexico Merida High-Level Consultative			
Group. This is the last one we will hold during the Calderon Administration. And I want to offer			
my personal appreciation to President Calderon and to Foreign Secretary Espinosa for their			
leadership and commitment to this partnership and to all on both sides of the border in our			
governments who have been deeply engaged and committed to it. The Merida Initiative			
represents an unprecedented level of security cooperation between Mexico and the United States.			
As our countries continue to deal with the serious challenge of transnational criminal			
organizations	 including drug traffickers	 illegal arms traffickers	 money launderers
gangs that threaten people on both sides of the border	 we well know there is no quick and easy		
way to stop these criminals and bring them to justice. But nevertheless	 during the past now		
nearly four years	 our countries have collaborated to an extraordinary and unprecedented degree.		
We have brought together policy makers and experts from across our governments and societies			
who have worked hand in hand to keep our people safe. And I think the habits of cooperation we			
have built are among our most important achievements	 and we will rely on them for a long time		
to come.			
Today	 our delegations reviewed the gains we've made on key priorities	 including improving	
law enforcement coordination	 reducing the demand for drugs	 modernizing our border	
infrastructure	 strengthening the rule of law	 and building more resilient and empowered	
communities. We also discussed the lessons we've learned and the work that lies ahead in these			
and other areas	 which our joint statement will reflect. I want to underscore how important our		
security relationship with Mexico is to the United States.			
The Government of Mexico and the Mexican people have faced the threat posed by these			
criminals with courage and resolve	 and we remain committed to doing everything we can to		
support Mexico as it continues to work to bring those criminals to justice. This is a transnational			
problem	 and it calls for a transnational solution	 and the United States believes this is a matter of	
shared responsibility. That was the first message I brought as Secretary of State when I came to			
Mexico	 and it continues to be the hallmark of our efforts together. Making sure our people are		
safe and our neighbors are safe is of the utmost importance to us.			
Now	 our two countries share many other priorities	 and one of them	 empowering women and
girls	 was also addressed today. We took the opportunity	 the Foreign Secretary and I	 to sign a
Memorandum of Understanding between our countries to work together to advance gender			
equality	 empower girls and women	 promote their human rights	 and enhance their security.
So again	 Secretary Espinosa	 let me thank you for years of work and effort	 for our productive
conversations in many places around the world and again today	 and for being such a valuable		
colleague and partner. The United States deeply	 deeply values our relationship with Mexico and		
the ties of family and friendship that connect so many millions of our people.

And we look forward to the future. We believe strongly that presidential administrations may			
change	 elections will come and go	 but we have established a firm foundation for cooperation	
that has already benefited both our countries and which will continue to benefit both of our			
countries for many years ahead. So thank you very much.			
MS. NULAND: We'll take (inaudible). Margaret Brennan	 CBS News.		
QUESTION: Madam Secretary	 thanks for your time. Are you any closer to finding who killed		
Ambassador Chris Stevens?	 Libya's President says this attack was planned for months. Are you		
confident he's wrong and that security measures were appropriate? And will you leave justice to			
the Libyans?			
SECRETARY CLINTON: As I said at the outset	 we are taking aggressive steps to protect our		
people and our consulates and embassies around the world. We are reviewing our security			
posture at every post and working with host governments to be sure they know what our security-			
needs are wherever necessary. We are also working closely with the Libyan Government to bring			
the perpetrators to justice so that we can be assured that we have found who murdered our four			
colleagues and under what circumstances. As I said	 the FBI has joined the investigation inside		
Libya	 and we will not rest until the people who orchestrated this attack are found and punished.		
It is also important to look at this strategically and understand what is going on across the region.			
In a number of places where protests have tuned violent	 we are seeing the hand of extremists		
who are trying to exploit people's inflamed passions for their own agendas. But overwhelmingly			
we have found that the people of Egypt	 of Libya	 of Yemen and Tunisia are not prepared to	
trade the tyranny of a dictator for the tyranny of a mob. They want to turn their attention to the			
future to provide better opportunities for themselves and their children	 and they want a strong		
partnership with the United States and the American people based on mutual interests and mutual			
respect.			
This is part of a larger debate that is going on inside these societies. In Libya	 for example	 in	
their first free elections	 moderates were successful at the polls. But look	 there are extremists in	
all of these societies and on the outside who are working to take advantage of broad outrage in			
order to incite violence and specifically incite violence against Americans and American			
facilities.			
And as I have said to many of the leaders I have spoken to over the past week	 these extremist		
efforts are a threat to the people of the societies and the governments of those societies as well as			
to the region and the United States. And I think it's important at this moment for leaders to put			
themselves on the right side of this debate - to speak out clearly and unequivocally against			
violence	 whoever incites it or conducts it		
And in a struggle like this	 there can be no doubt where the United States must stand. We support		
those who are fighting for the same values and rights that we believe in - in democracy	 in

freedom	 in universal rights for men and women	 for justice and accountability. And I want to	
underscore that the United States will continue to work with partners and allies in the region and			
around the world to help bring security to these nations so that the promise of the revolutions that			
they experienced can be realized.			
And finally	 on your specific point about Benghazi	 we obviously never talk publicly about	
security at any of our missions for obvious reasons. But that said	 let me assure you that our		
security in Benghazi included a unit of host government security forces	 as well as a local guard		
force of the kind that we rely on in many places around the world. In addition to the security			
outside the compound	 we relied on a wall and a robust security presence inside the compound.		
And with all of our missions overseas	 in advance of September lid'	 as is done every year	 we
did an evaluation on threat streams. And the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has			
said we had no actionable intelligence that an attack on our post in Benghazi was planned or			
imminent.			
But let me state the obvious again. Our diplomats engage in dangerous work	 and it's the nature		
of diplomacy in fragile societies and conflict zones to be aware of the necessity for security but			
to also continue the important diplomatic work that has to go on. There is risk inherent in what			
we do and what these brave men and women representing the United States are up against every

Remarks With Indonesian Foreign Minister Raden Mohammad Marty Muliana			
Natalegawa After Their Meeting			
20-Sep	2012		
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good afternoon	 everyone. And it's such a pleasure	 as always	 to
welcome the Indonesian Foreign Minister	 and I believe the largest delegation that has ever come		
from Indonesia	 for the purpose of our third meeting of the U.S.-Indonesia Joint Commission.		
This commission is the result of a vision by our two presidents for a comprehensive partnership			
and the agreement to that effect was signed in 2010. Thanks to this partnership	 the United States		
and Indonesia are working more closely than ever on a range of issues from global security to			
clean energy and climate to regional trade and commerce.			
And today	 Marty and I had the chance to take stock of where our teams have come in the time		
of the last year	 because we liad our meeting in Bali a year ago. And I must say	 I was very	
impressed. We covered a great deal today.

But before I start	 I'd like to say a few words about the protests in several countries around the		
world. We have condemned in the strongest possible terms the violence that has erupted from			
these protests. And as I have said	 the video that sparked these protests is disgusting and		
reprehensible	 and the United States Government	 of course	 had absolutely nothing to do with it.
But there is no justification for violence	 and I want to thank the Foreign Minister and his		
government for speaking out against violence. We have to look to reasonable people and			
responsible leaders everywhere to stand up to extremists who would seek to take advantage of			
this moment to commit violent acts against embassies and their fellow countrymen.			
Today's meetings have highlighted the strong foundation that we have built together. And one of			
our most important concerns is promoting peace and stability in the Asia Pacific. Today	 I'm		
announcing that the Obama Administration has informed Congress of the potential sale of eight			
AH-64D Apache Longbow helicopters to the Indonesian Government. This agreement will			
strengthen our comprehensive partnership and help enhance security across the region.			
On growth and prosperity	 we are increasing our trade relationship that topped $26 billion last		
year. Investments in transportation	 energy	 and infrastructure are creating jobs and supporting	
economic growth in both countries. For example	 the deal between Lion Air and Boeing alone		
represents $21 billion in trade over the next decade. Indonesia's Government has announced half			
a trillion dollars in infrastructure improvements	 and we recently signed a memorandum of		
understanding to make it easier for American companies to bid on these projects.			
And yesterday	 we signed an agreement for implementing our Millennium Challenge		
Corporation Compact with Indonesia. Over the next five years	 the United States will invest $600		
million in clean energy development	 child health and nutrition programs	 and efforts to help	
make Indonesia's Government more transparent and open.			
The United States is also looking forward to Indonesia hosting APEC in 2013	 and we are		
confident that Indonesia will come to this role with a commitment to promote greater economic			
integration across the Asia Pacific.			
Both the Foreign Minister and I believe that strong education is essential to compete in a modem			
global economy. That's why the United States has expanded the Fulbright Program and			
supported partnerships between dozens of American and Indonesian universities. Academic			
exchanges between our countries are up and applications from Indonesian students to visit the			
United States have increased by one third. USAID has recently expanded its basic education			
program to provide $83 million for teacher training and literacy programs for young children.			
And we're providing $20 in scholarship funding for Indonesian graduate students.

I also thanked the Minister for Indonesia's leadership in ASEAN. The Foreign Minister's			
personal leadership has helped lay the groundwork for diplomacy between ASEAN and China as			
it relates to the South China Sea. And we continue to support ASEAN's six-point principles			
which we believe will help reduce tensions and pave the way for a comprehensive code of			
conduct for addressing disputes without threats	 coercion	 or use of force.	
Finally. Indonesia and the United States have stood together on a range of global challenges			
from democratic reform in Burma to combating climate change	 to working to end the violence		
in Syria. We are also coordinating efforts to further develop south-south and triangular			
cooperation	 such as enhancing disaster preparedness in Burma and convening a conference on		
women's empowerment.			
We believe that as the second and third-largest democracies in the world	 the United States and		
Indonesia have a special responsibility to promote democracy and human rights. And for the last			
four years	 Indonesia has hosted the Bali Democracy Forum to promote peaceful	 democratic	
transitions through example and open dialogue. Last year	 more than 80 countries attended. And		
once again	 the United States will be sending a high-level delegation.		
So	 Minister	 thank you for everything. Thank you for the great partnership we've had between	
us and between our countries.			
MS. NULAND: We'll take two questions today	 we'll start with Ros Jordan of Al Jazeera		
English.			
QUESTION: Thank you	 Madam Secretary	 Mr. Foreign Minister. Madam Secretary	 my
question is about the ongoing investigation into last week's attack at the consulate in Benghazi.			
You are meeting this afternoon with members of Congress to discuss the progress and the			
concerns that they understandably have. First	 there is the federal mandate to establish an		
accountability review board. Have you done so? Who would you like to see chair it? Are there			
certain questions that you desperately want to have answered in order to safeguard the safety of			
Foreign Service Officers around the world?			
And related to this	 given the political instability and the successes of the past year and a half	 are	
you satisfied that in light of those political changes	 enough was done to protect those working in		
the Middle East and North Africa? And then finally — and this is perhaps going into the area of			
rumor and speculation — but there is at least one report suggesting that Ambassador Stevens felt			
that he was on a	 quote	 ""al-Qaida hit list"" Is this a scurrilous rumor? Is this gallows humor	
when one is working in a period of difficulty and great challenge	 or is there something more to		
what he allegedly — and I stress that word — said?

SECRETARY CLINTON: Well	 first	 let me say I'm looking forward to the opportunity to go	
up to the Congress today. I will be briefing in two separate sessions	 the House and the Senate	 in	
a classified setting	 along with my interagency colleagues	 as we continue to work together	 and
with governments around the world	 to ensure that our people and our facilities are safe. I will be		
joined today by the Director of National Intelligence	 General Clapper	 by the Deputy Secretary	
of Defense	 Ash Carter	 by the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff	 Sandy Winnefeld
along with experts from the FBI	 the State Department	 and elsewhere in the government.	
Now	 I anticipate that this briefing will cover our security posture before and during the events		
and the steps we have taken since to do everything we can with host governments to protect our			
people and our embassies and consulates. The Director of National Intelligence will speak to the			
intelligence issues surrounding these events in Libya. Deputy Secretary Carter will brief on the			
superb support we have had from the U.S. military in the wake of these events	 and we are at the		
very early stages of an FBI investigation. The team from the FBI reached Libya earlier this week.			
And I will advise Congress also that I am launching an accountability review board that will be			
chaired by Ambassador Thomas Pickering.			
I will also talk about the importance of the broader relationships with these countries in light of			
the events of the past days. There are obviously very real challenges in these new democracies			
these fragile societies	 but as I said last week	 the vast majority of the people in these countries	
did not throw off the tyranny of a dictator to trade it for the tyranny of a mob. And we are			
concerned first and foremost with our own people and facilities	 but we are concerned about the		
internal security in these countries because ultimately	 that puts at risk the men	 women	 and
children of these societies on a daily ongoing basis if actions are not taken to try to restore			
security and civil order.			
And let me just conclude by saying that there can be no doubt where the United States stands.			
We continue to support those who are fighting for universal values — values that we see at work			
in Indonesia — the third largest democracy in the world. We believe that these values of universal			
rights	 of justice and accountability	 of democracy	 are there for every person regardless of where
that person might live. So I will look forward to having a chance to talk with members of			
Congress.			
As to your final question	 I have absolutely no information or reason to believe that there's any		
basis for that.			
QUESTION: Thank you.			
MS. NULAND: Last question. Victoria Sidjabat from Tempo Magazine	 please.		
QUESTION: Yes. Madam	 thank you. My question is: Starting today	 U.S. Embassy and	
Consulate are closed in Indonesia as the Muslim movie become wild fireball	 which could be

designed as a weapon to attack U.S. by raising sentiment anti-U.S. from the countries which has			
Muslim majority population like Indonesia.			
Madam Clinton	 how do you see this threat as on the long run? If it's continuing happen	 it's —	
obviously could give impact to the implementation of (inaudible) program in Indonesia. What is			
the reason U.S. Government closed the Embassy and Consulate in Indonesia? What is your			
expectation from Indonesia Government	 for my Minister Marty Natalegawa? How Indonesia		
Government respond to the closing of this Embassy and Consulate	 it's starting today? Is U.S. —		
Indonesia Government has capability to protect U.S. Embassy and Consulate. So the (inaudible)			
program implemented — could be implemented successfully in Indonesia. Thank you.			
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well	 let me begin by saying how grateful we are for the excellent		
cooperation we have received from the Government of Indonesia	 and in particular	 from the law	
enforcement and security institutions in Indonesia. We are very grateful for not only the			
cooperation and protection that has been provided to our facilities	 but also to the strong		
statements condemning violence from the President	 the Foreign Mihister	 and others.	
In consultation with the Government of Indonesia	 we have temporarily	 for tomorrow	 closed
our facilities. We want to be sure that law enforcement in Indonesia has the ability to do what it			
needs to do to make sure that there is no disruption of civil order and security. So we are			
cooperating completely	 and we're very grateful for the strong leadership provided by Indonesia.		
FOREIGN MINISTER NATALEGAWA: Hello	 (inaudible)	 if I may just also respond.	
Precisely as the Secretary had said	 the decision by the United States Government to close		
temporarily its embassies and consulates tomorrow in Indonesia is a decision that's been made			
based on communication and conversation between the authorities in Indonesia and the United			
States as well. So in other words	 it is an informed decision	 a decision that is not intended to	
show any unfriendly intent on the part of anyone	 but it is what it is	 and it's quite some — it's the	
kind of step that governments actually carry out when situations requires it	 even in our case.		
Some of our embassies abroad	 when the situation requires us to have a temporary closing of the		
embassy	 we do that as well. So it is something that is quite regular and something that is		
actually coordinated as well.			
But if I may just broaden the subject matter	 I think as our President had said in the past		
Indonesian Government the Indonesian people	 even	 obviously cannot and would not condone	
the — any acts of violence against diplomatic premises	 against diplomatic personnel	 because	
that is	 truly — would be a challenge to the efficient and a proper conduct of relations among		
states. So that's our point of departure.			
At the same time	 of course	 beyond the immediate issue of protection of the embassies	 we have
still ahead of us the challenge of how to prevent the kind of situations where we are now at in

terms of the kind of incendiary and the kind of statements or	 in this instance	 films that cause —

Remarks With Pakistani Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar Before Their Meeting			
21-Sep	2012		
Good afternoon	 and let me begin by welcoming Foreign Minister Khar on her first visit to		
Washington as foreign minister. We've had the opportunity to meet in Islamabad and other			
settings	 but I am very pleased that we would have this chance to exchange views on our bilateral		
relationship as well as regional and global issues.			
I want to begin by addressing the events of the day and the past week. Today	 we've once again		
seen protests in several cities in Pakistan. Unfortunately	 some of those protests have turned		
violent and	 sadly	 resulted in loss of life. I want to thank the Government of Pakistan for their	
efforts to protect our Embassy in Islamabad and consulates in Lahore	 Peshawar	 and Karachi.	
And I want to be clear	 as I have said on numerous occasions	 the violence we have seen cannot	
be tolerated. There is no justification for violence. Of course	 there is provocation	 and we have	
certainly made clear that we do not in any way support provocation. We found the video that's at			
the core of this series of events offensive	 disgusting	 reprehensible.	
But that does not provide justification for violence	 and therefore it is important for responsible		
leaders	 indeed responsible people everywhere	 to stand up and speak out against violence and	
particularly against those who would exploit this difficult moment to advance their own			
extremist ideologies.			
Yesterday afternoon when I briefed the Congress	 I made it clear that keeping our people		
everywhere in the world safe is our top priority. What happened in Benghazi was a terrorist			
attack	 and we will not rest until we have tracked down and brought to justice the terrorists who		
murdered four Americans. And we are taking aggressive measures at all of our posts to protect			
our staffs and their families along with locally employed people who provide so many important			
contributions to the work of our missions.			
The Foreign Minister and I will have a chance to cover a full range of subjects today	 and it is no		
secret that the past year and a half has been challenging for Pakistan and the United States. And			
we still have work to do to get our bilateral relationship to the point where we would like it to be			
but we both recognize that we can achieve more when we work together on a focused agenda. So

today is the latest in a series of high-level meetings. Ambassador Marc Grossman has just			
returned from consultations in Islamabad. I look forward to seeing President Zardari next week			
at the UN General Assembly. At each meeting	 we are working to identify the strategic goals we		
share — and there are many — and the concrete actions we can each take to accomplish them.			
Our number one shared priority remains pursuing our joint counterterrorism objectives to ensure			
the security of American and Pakistani citizens alike. We face a common threat from a common			
enemy	 and we must confront terrorism and extremism together. Earlier this month	 I designated	
the Haqqani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization so we could make full use of every			
available legal authority to end their deadly attacks. Pakistan's parliament has called for			
expelling foreign fighters so that Pakistan's territory can be fully under control of the Pakistani			
Government and cannot be used to launch attacks against other nations.			
And the follow-through on this is challenging but necessary	 and we look forward to working		
with Pakistan as they continue to address these problems. We have both pledged to support a			
secure	 stable	 and prosperous Afghanistan	 which is vital for the security of the region. And I
want to thank Foreign Minister Khar for Pakistan's reopening of the NATO supply lines to allow			
the movement of goods to Afghanistan.			
We will discuss the successful first meeting of the Safe Passage Working Group in Islamabad			
which brought together Afghan	 Pakistani	 and U.S. representatives to advance the peace process	
in Afghanistan. The Pakistani Government's public call for insurgents to come forward and talk			
with the Afghan Government was particularly important. We are ready to work together to build			
on these steps	 and we will continue our discussions through bilateral consultations and the U.S.-		
Afghanistan-Pakistan Core Group.			
Now	 of course	 our relationship goes far beyond our shared security concerns	 and today we will
discuss the many other ways in which we work together	 particularly to create economic		
opportunity for Pakistanis. Foreign Minister Khar and I agree that we need to shift our economic			
relationship from aid to trade and investment. We are working to help Pakistan attract more			
private sector investment. We hope to finalize a bilateral investment treaty soon. And we've			
created a Pakistan private investment initiative to help more of Pakistan's small and medium			
sized companies get access to capital.			
Over the past few years	 we have seen Pakistan's civilian government begin to put down stronger		
roots. And if elections proceed as planned next year	 it will mark the first time in Pakistan's		
history that a civilian-led government has served its full term. The United States supports			
Pakistan's economic development	 and we have said many times that we want to see democracy		
succeed in Pakistan.

We also support Pakistan's sovereignty	 but we are clear that all sovereign nations carry certain		
obligations to protect the human rights of their citizens	 to control their territory	 to prevent	
threats to their neighbors and the international community.			
So we know that there is still much to be done	 but I can assure the people of Pakistan that the		
United States remains committed to this important relationship and we are confident we can			
continue to move forward together one step at a time to reach our shared strategic objectives.			
Thank you very much.			
Remarks With Tunisian Foreign Minister Rank Abdessalem Before Their Meeting			
21-Sep	2012		
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good morning. I am pleased to welcome the Foreign Minister from			
Tunisia I'm looking forward to our meeting	 We obviously have a great deal to discuss	 and I	
want to thank the Foreign Minister and the Government of Tunisia for their efforts over the last			
week to help secure our Embassy and the American Cooperative School of Tunis following the			
violent assaults of last Friday.			
We are monitoring events closely today. There is no higher priority for President Obama and			
myself than the safety of our people. We've taken a number of steps around the world to			
augment security and to protect our personnel at diplomatic posts. And we are working closely			
with host governments in this effort.			
As I have said before and as is embodied in the Vienna Convention and other international			
agreements	 all governments have the duty	 the solemn duty	 to defend diplomatic missions.
They must be safe and protected places so that governments can exchange views and work on			
many important issues	 and leaders across the world must stand up and be counted in rejecting		
violence and holding violent actors accountable.			
We are working closely with the Government of Tunisia They have assisted us in enhancing the			
security of our facilities. We've also discussed with them the imperative of bringing to justice			
those responsible for these violent attacks. And we have offered and will continue to look for			
ways that we can assist the new Government of Tunisia in ensuring the rule of law throughout			
their country	 first and foremost for the people of Tunisia themselves. We look forward to		
continuing to build our hew partnership with the Tunisian Government and people. Our			
relationship is built around the shared principles of all democracies — a commitment to			
nonviolence	 to tolerance	 and inclusivity for all people	 and to upholding the rule of law.
The Tunisian people have bravely put themselves on the road to democracy. They were the first			
of the Arab revolutions and they have made important progress in a very short period of time.			
They have worked too hard and sacrificed too much over too many years to see their progress			
hijacked at derailed by extremists with Ulric own a5	-.

Tunisia but in too many places around the world	 look for opportunities to exploit this current		
situation or other situations	 and all people and leaders must stand against them.		
So as the Tunisian Government takes steps to strengthen security and protect the Tunisian people			
and economy from extremism and violent agendas	 the United States stands ready to help. We		
also are working closely with Tunisia on the broader shared threat of terrorism	 including from		
groups like al-Qaida and its affiliates.			
So Minister	 please know the United States remains committed to supporting Tunisia as you deal		
with this current situation	 as you continue your democratic transition	 and we want to be with	
you as you confront challenges and help seize opportunities together for the betterment of the			
future of Tunisia.

Statement on the Attack in Benghazi
September 11, 2012
I condemn in the strongest terms the attack on our mission in Benghazi today. As we work to
secure our personnel and facilities, we have confirmed that one of our State Department officers
was killed. We are heartbroken by this terrible loss. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family
and those who have suffered in this attack.
This evening, I called Libyan President Magariaf to coordinate additional support to protect
Americans in Libya. President Magariaf expressed his condemnation and condolences and
pledged his government's full cooperation.
Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted
on the Internet. The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs
of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation.
But let me be clear: There is never any justification for violent acts of this kind.
In light of the events of today, the United States government is working with partner countries
around the world to protect our personnel, our missions, and American citizens worldwide.
Statement on the Death of American Personnel in Benghazi, Libya
September 12, 2012
It is with profound sadness that I share the news of the death of four American personnel in
Benghazi, Libya yesterday. Among them were United States Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens
and Foreign Service Information Management Officer, Sean Smith. We are still making next of
kin notifications for the other two individuals. Our hearts go out to all their families and
colleagues.
A 21 year veteran of the Foreign Service, Ambassador Stevens died last night from injuries he
sustained in the attack on our office in Benghazi.
I had the privilege of swearing in Chris for his post in Libya only a few months ago. He spoke
eloquently about his passion for service, for diplomacy and for the Libyan people. This
assignment was only the latest in his more than two decades of dedication to advancing closer
ties with the people of the Middle East and North Africa which began as a Peace Corps
Volunteer in Morocco. As the conflict in Libya unfolded, Chris was one of the first Americans
on the ground in Benghazi. He risked his own life to lend the Libyan people a helping hand to
build the foundation for a new, free nation. He spent every day since helping to finish the work
that he started. Chris was committed to advancing America's values and interests, even when
that meant putting himself in danger.
Sean Smith was a husband and a father of two, who joined the Department ten years ago. Like

Chris, Sean was one of our best. Prior to arriving in Benghazi, he served in Baghdad, Pretoria,
Montreal, and most recently The Hague.
All the Americans we lost in yesterday's attacks made the ultimate sacrifice. We condemn this
vicious and violent attack that took their lives, which they had committed to helping the Libyan
people reach for a better future.
America's diplomats and development experts stand on the front lines every day for our country.
We are honored by the service of each and every one of them.
Remarks on the Deaths of American Personnel in Benghazi, Libya
September 12, 2012
Yesterday, our U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya was attacked. Heavily armed militants
assaulted the compound and set fire to our buildings. American and Libyan security personnel
battled the attackers together. Four Americans were killed. They included Sean Smith, a Foreign
Service information management officer, and our Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens. We are
still making next of kin notifications for the other two individuals.
This is an attack that should shock the conscience of people of all faiths around the world. We
condemn in the strongest terms this senseless act of violence, and we send our prayers to the
families, friends, and colleagues of those we've lost.
All over the world, every day, America's diplomats and development experts risk their lives in
the service of our country and our values, because they believe that the United States must be a
force for peace and progress in the world, that these aspirations are worth striving and sacrificing
for. Alongside our men and women in uniform, they represent the best traditions of a bold and
generous nation.
In the lobby of this building, the State Department, the names of those who have fallen in the line
of duty are inscribed in marble. Our hearts break over each one. And now, because of this
tragedy, we have new heroes to honor and more friends to mourn.
Chris Stevens fell in love with the Middle East as a young Peace Corps volunteer teaching
English in Morocco. He joined the Foreign Service, learned languages, won friends for America
in distant places, and made other people's hopes his own.
In the early days of the Libyan revolution, I asked Chris to be our envoy to the rebel opposition.
He arrived on a cargo ship in the port of Benghazi and began building our relationships with
Libya's revolutionaries. He risked his life to stop a tyrant, then gave his life trying to help build a
better Libya. The world needs more Chris Stevenses. I spoke with his sister, Ann, this morning,
and told her that he will be remembered as a hero by many nations.

Sean Smith was an Air Force veteran. He spent 10 years as an information management officer
in the State Department, he was posted at The Hague, and was in Libya on a brief temporary
assignment. He was a husband to his wife Heather, with whom I spoke this morning. He was a
father to two young children, Samantha and Nathan. They will grow up being proud of the
service their father gave to our country, service that took him from Pretoria to Baghdad, and
finally to Benghazi.
The mission that drew Chris and Sean and their colleagues to Libya is both noble and necessary,
and we and the people of Libya honor their memory by carrying it forward. This is not easy.
Today, many Americans are asking — indeed, I asked myself— how could this happen? How
could this happen in a country we helped liberate, in a city we helped save from destruction?
This question reflects just how complicated and, at times, how confounding the world can be.
But we must be clear-eyed, even in our grief. This was an attack by a small and savage group —
not the people or Government of Libya. Everywhere Chris and his team went in Libya, in a
country scarred by war and tyranny, they were hailed as friends and partners. And when the
attack came yesterday, Libyans stood and fought to defend our post. Some were wounded.
Libyans carried Chris' body to the hospital, and they helped rescue and lead other Americans to
safety. And last night, when I spoke with the President of Libya, he strongly condemned the
violence and pledged every effort to protect our people and pursue those responsible.
The friendship between our countries, borne out of shared struggle, will not be another casualty
of this attack. A free and stable Libya is still in America's interest and security, and we will not
turn our back on that, nor will we rest until those responsible for these attacks are found and
brought to justice. We are working closely with the Libyan authorities to move swiftly and
surely. We are also working with partners around the world to safeguard other American
embassies, consulates, and citizens.
There will be more time later to reflect, but today, we have work to do. There is no higher
priority than protecting our men and women wherever they serve. We are working to determine
the precise motivations and methods of those who carried out this assault. Some have sought to
justify this vicious behavior, along with the protest that took place at our Embassy in Cairo
yesterday, as a response to inflammatory material posted on the intemet. America's commitment
to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear — there is
no justification for this, none. Violence like this is no way to honor religion or faith. And as long
as there are those who would take innocent life in the name of God, the world will never know a
true and lasting peace.
It is especially difficult that this happened on September I I th. It's an anniversary that means a
great deal to all Americans. Every year on that day, we are reminded that our work is not yet
finished, that the job of putting an end to violent extremism and building a safe and stable world
continues. But September 11th means even more than that. It is a day on which we remember

Statement on the Deaths of Tyrone S. Woods and Glen A. Doherty in Benghazi, Libya
September 13, 2012
The attack on our diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya on Tuesday claimed the lives of four
Americans. Yesterday, I spoke about two: Ambassador Chris Stevens and Information
Management Officer Sean Smith. Today, we also recognize the two security personnel who died
helping protect their colleagues. Tyrone S. Woods and Glen A. Doherty were both decorated
military veterans who served our country with honor and distinction. Our thoughts, prayers, and
deepest gratitude are with their families and friends. Our embassies could not carry on our
critical work around the world without the service and sacrifice of brave people like Tyrone and
Glen.
Tyrone's friends and colleagues called him ""Rone,"" and they relied on his courage and skill,
honed over two decades as a Navy SEAL. In uniform, he served multiple tours in Iraq and
Afghanistan. Since 2010, he protected American diplomatic personnel in dangerous posts from
Central America to the Middle East. He had the hands of a healer as well as the arm of a warrior,
earning distinction as a registered nurse and certified paramedic. All our hearts go out to
Tyrone's wife Dorothy and his three sons, Tyrone Jr., Hunter, and Kai, who was born just a few
months ago.
We also grieve for Glen Doherty, called Bub, and his family: his father Bernard, his mother
Barbara, his brother Gregory, and his sister Kathleen. Glen was also a former Navy SEAL and an
experienced paramedic. And he put his life on the line many times, protecting Americans in Iraq,
Afghanistan, and other hotspots. In the end, he died the way he lived — with selfless honor and
unstinting valor.
We condemn the attack that took the lives of these heroes in the strongest terms, and we are
taking additional steps to safeguard American embassies, consulates, and citizens around the
world. This violence should shock the conscience of people of all faiths and traditions. We
appreciate the statements of support that have poured in from across the region and beyond.

People of conscience and goodwill everywhere must stand together in these difficult days against
violence, hate, and division.
I am enormously proud of the men and women who risk their lives every day in the service of
our country and our values. They help make the United States the greatest force for peace,
progress, and human dignity that the world has ever known, We honor the memory of our fallen
colleagues by continuing their work and carrying on the best traditions of a bold and generous
nation.
Remarks at the Opening Plenary of the U.S.-Morocco Strategic Dialogue
September 13, 2012
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good morning. Well, let me welcome our friends and colleagues
from Morocco here to the Benjamin Franklin Room on the eighth floor of the State Department
for this very important first session of the U.S.-Morocco Strategic Dialogue. Before I begin to
address the significance of this Strategic Dialogue and the next step in our long relations with
Morocco, I want to say a few words about the events unfolding in the world today.
We are closely watching what is happening in Yemen and elsewhere, and we certainly hope and
expect that there will be steps taken to avoid violence and prevent the escalation of protests into
violence.
I also want to take a moment to address the video circulating on the Internet that has led to these
protests in a number of countries. Let me state very clearly — and I hope it is obvious — that the
United States Government had absolutely nothing to do with this video. We absolutely reject its
content and message. America's commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very
beginning of our nation. And as you know, we are home to people of all religions, many of
whom came to this country seeking the right to exercise their own religion, including, of course,
millions of Muslims. And we have the greatest respect for people of faith.
To us, to me personally, this video is disgusting and reprehensible. It appears to have a deeply
cynical purpose: to denigrate a great religion and to provoke rage. But as I said yesterday, there
is no justification, none at all, for responding to this video with violence, We condemn the
violence that has resulted in the strongest terms, and we greatly appreciate that many Muslims in
the United States and around the world have spoken out on this issue.
Violence, we believe, has no place in religion and is no way to honor religion. Islam, like other
religions, respects the fundamental dignity of human beings, and it is a violation of that
fundamental dignity to wage attacks on innocents. As long as there are those who are willing to
shed blood and take innocent life in the name of religion, the name of God, the world will never
know a true and lasting peace. It is especially wrong for violence to be directed against
diplomatic missions. These are places whose very purpose is peaceful: to promote better
understuiding across countries and cultures. All governments have a responsibility to protect

those spaces and people, because to attack an embassy is to attack the idea that we can work
together to build understanding and a better future.
Now, I know it is hard for some people to understand why the United States cannot or does not
just prevent these kinds of reprehensible videos from ever seeing the light of day. Now, I would
note that in today's world with today's technologies, that is impossible. But even if it were
possible, our country does have a long tradition of free expression which is enshrined in our
Constitution and our law, and we do not stop individual citizens from expressing their views no
matter how distasteful they may be.
There are, of course, different views around the world about the outer limits of free speech and
free expression, but there should be no debate about the simple proposition that violence in
response to speech is not acceptable. We all — whether we are leaders in government, leaders in
civil society or religious leaders — must draw the line at violence. And any responsible leader
should be standing up now and drawing that line.
I wanted to begin with this statement, because, as our Moroccan friends and all of you know, this
has been a difficult week at the State Department. I very much appreciate, Minister, the
condolences your government expressed to our Embassy in Rabat And even though that tragedy
happened far away in Benghazi, we found a reminder of the deep bounds that connect Morocco
to the United States. It was in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco that one of the Americans
we lost this week, Ambassador Chris Stevens, fell in love with the region when he served as a
Peace Corps volunteer there. That experience set him on a decades-long career of service. So in
the memory of fallen friends and colleagues, let us remind ourselves of the many ways in which
riot just our governments but the people of our two nations have worked together to build a better
future.
In many ways, the United States looks to Morocco to be a leader and a model. His Majesty King
Mohammed deserves great credit for the work you've undertaken. In fact, after my visit to Rabat
earlier this year. I told my team: ""We need to start a Strategic Dialogue with Morocco."" No
country has been a friend of the United States longer than Morocco. You were the first nation to
recognize us back in 1777. But we're not satisfied with simply having a friendship that is
longstanding We want one that is dynamic, growing, looking toward the future. So let me
highlight a few of the areas we should focus on today.
On political reform, we have all seen remarkable changes taking place across North Africa and
the Middle East. I commend Morocco and your government for your efforts to stay ahead of
these changes by holding free and fair elections, empowering the elected parliament, taking other
steps to ensure that the government reflects the will of the people. Today, our political working
group will discuss how the United States can continue to support your efforts to translate
commitments into actions. Because as we all know, democracy, real reform, require that people
themselves feel the changes in their evetyday lives: the courts reformed, the government more

open and transparent, universal human rights of all Moroccans — men and women alike —
respected.
I'm especially pleased by Morocco's commitments to take on the deeply troubling problem of
child marriage. We know that child brides are less likely to get an education, more likely to face
life-threatening problems, particularly around child birth and delivery, which not only
shortchanges them but can even rob them and their communities of their lives and talents. So we
want to encourage the government and civil society to continue their important work together on
this issue.
With regard to the Western Sahara, the United States continues to support efforts to find a
peaceful, sustainable, mutually agreed-upon solution. U.S. policy toward the Western Sahara has
remained consistent for many years. We have made clear that Morocco's autonomy plan is
serious, realistic, and credible, and that it represents a potential approach that could satisfy the
aspirations of the people in the Western Sahara to run their own affairs in peace and dignity. We
continue to support the negotiations carried out by the United Nations and hope parties can work
toward resolution.
With respect to the economy, our second working group will focus on what more can be done to
deliver tangible economic benefits. Morocco's economy is relatively healthy, but you face the
same problem that is now endemic across the world — unemployment is still too high, especially
among young people.
That's why the United States is providing $1.5 million to support an effort to attract foreign
investors, foster local economic development, and combat corruption across the region. And I'm
pleased to announce that later this year we will hold a Morocco business development
conference here in Washington to connect businesses from both countries.
Today, we should discuss ways to build on all of these efforts by increasing bilateral trade, a
particular goal of mine since so much trade from Morocco goes to Europe. I'd like to increase
the amount of trade coming to the United States, and also to improve economic integration
across North Africa, which could greatly benefit Morocco because of Morocco's stability and
Morocco's very strong economic foundation. The greater integration there is, the greater the
benefits for Moroccans.
Third, the attack in Benghazi this week reminds us that security remains a vital issue. Through
our work together on the Global Counterterrorism Task Force, the United States and Morocco
already share crucial information and best practices, and I thank Morocco for hosting a Global
Counterterrorism Task Force workshop on threats in the South Atlantic next month.

We are also collaborating through USAID, the Peace Corps, and other agencies to help provide
Moroccan youth with alternatives to criminal and extremist organizations. And so we are
partnering to help strengthen Morocco's criminal justice system and law enforcement.
There will be a lot to discuss in the meeting today. And let me add, the United States greatly
appreciates the constructive role Morocco is playing on the UN Security Council, especially your
support for the effort to end the violence and bloodshed in Syria and help to usher in a new
democratic future for that country. I commend Morocco for offering to host the next ministerial
meeting of the Friends of the Syrian People, and we look forward to continuing to work closely
together as close partners even after your term on the Security Council has ended.
Finally, our education and cultural ties are reason for much celebration. This year marks the 30th
anniversary of our official program to facilitate academic exchanges and other bonds between us.
There are more than 5,000 Moroccan alumni of these programs. Two are with us today — Dr.
Benjelloun and Dr. Ouaouicha — and we thank them. But among all our work on this front, from
preserving Morocco's historic sites to empowering youth, there's one area I particularly hope we
can focus on today and receive your advice and counsel — namely, interfaith dialogue.
In these tense and turbulent times, it's more important than ever for people of different faiths to
exchange ideas, to build understanding, to promote religious tolerance. It's one of the great
challenges of the 21st century, and it's one that we must address together.
So we have a lot of work to do, Minister, but our friendship runs long and deep, and as the treaty
our nations signed in 1786 says, and I quote, ""Trusting in God, it will remain permanent."" I'm
confident that we will continue to solve problems and produce results that make our nations
stronger, more peaceful, more secure, more prosperous, and also contribute to doing the same for
the world.
So again, let me welcome you, Minister. It's been a great pleasure for me to get to know you, to
work with you, to be your colleague bilaterally, regionally, and globally, and also welcome your
distinguished delegation.
Thank you. (Applause.)

Tonight, our gathering is more somber than any of us would like. This comes during sad and
difficult days for the State Department family. We lost four Americans. They were good and
brave men. They were committed to the cause of building a brighter future for the people of
Libya. And we condemn the violence in the strongest terms, the violence against our posts in
Benghazi, in Egypt, and now in Yemen.
The Libyan ambassador is with us tonight, and I want to take a moment to thank him for the
support that his government and the Libyan people have shown to the United States in this
tragedy, particularly the outpouring of feelings of grief and loss because of the killing of our
ambassador.
Ambassador Aujali, would you mind saying a few words?
AMBASSADOR AMU: [redacted]
SECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you very much, Ambassador. I know that that was a very
personal loss for you, as it was for me. I'm the one who sent Chris to Benghazi during the
revolution to show support and be able to advise our government about what we could do to
bring freedom and democracy and opportunity to the people of Libya.
Religious freedom and religious tolerance are essential to the stability of any nation, any people.
Hatred and violence in the name of religion only poison the well. All people of faith and good
will know that the actions of a small and savage group in Benghazi do not honor religion or God
in any way. Nor do they speak for the more than one billion Muslims around the world, many of
whom have shown an outpouring of support during this time
Unfortunately, however, over the last 24 hours, we have also seen violence spread elsewhere.
Some seek to justify this behavior as a response to inflammatory, despicable material posted on
the intemet. As I said earlier today, the United States rejects both the content and the message of
that video. The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of
others. At our meeting earlier today, my colleague, the foreign minister of Morocco, said that all
prophets should be respected because they are all symbols of our humanity, for all humanity.
But both of us were crystal clear in this paramount message: There is never any justification for
violent acts of this kind. And we look to leaders around the world to stand up and speak out
against violence, and to take steps to protect diplomatic missions from attack.
Think about it. When Christians are subject to insults to their faith, and that certainly happens,
we expect them not to resort to violence. When Hindus or Buddhists are subjected to insults to
their faiths, and that also certainly happens, we expect them not to resort to violence. The same
goes for all faiths, including Islam.

When all of us who are people of faith - and I am one — feel the pain of insults, of
misunderstanding, of denigration to what we cherish, we must expect ourselves and others not to
resort to violence, That is a universal standard and expectation, and it is everyone's obligation to
meet that, so that we make no differences, we expect no less of ourselves than we expect of
others, You cannot respond to offensive speech with violence without begetting more violence.
And I so strongly believe that the great religions of the world are stronger than any insults. They
have withstood offense for centuries. Refraining from violence, then, is not a sign of weakness in
one's faith; it is absolutely the opposite, a sign that one's faith is unshakable.
So tonight, we must come together and recommit ourselves to working toward a future marked
by understanding and acceptance rather than distrust, hatred, and fear. We can pledge that
whenever one person speaks out in ignorance and bigotry, ten voices will answer. They will
answer resoundingly against the offense and the insult, answering ignorance with enlightenment,
answering hatred with understanding, answering darkness with light; that if one person commits
a violent act in the name of religion, millions will stand up and condemn it out of strength.
In times like these, it can be easy to despair that some differences are irreconcilable, some
mountains too steep to climb; we will therefore never reach the level of understanding and
peacefulness that we seek, and which I believe the great religions of the world call us to pursue.
But that's not what I believe, and I don't think it's what you believe eith"		
r here tonight. Part of			
what makes our country so special is we keep trying. We keep working. We keep investing in			
our future. We keep supporting the next generation	 believing that young people can keep us		
moving forward in a positive direction.			
So tonight I think it's important that we talk not just about that better tomorrow that we all seek			
but also about some of the things — the real	 practical	 tangible things — that young people are	
doing to help shape that better future.			
Two years ago in this room	 at our Eid reception	 we launched a program called Generation	
Change to lead a grassroots agenda of positive engagement with Muslim communities. And I			
asked the young Muslim leaders in the audience that night to be our unofficial ambassadors	 to		
help build personal connections	 seek out partners in other countries. And I can report to you		
tonight they did not disappoint. In a few minutes	 you're going to meet some of these young		
leaders	 each with a powerful story to tell.		
The Generation Change network that started in this room now circles the globe. We are building			
an international alliance of young people who want to drive change in their own communities.			
They act as mentors	 spark respectful debates	 simply offer words of encouragement when	
needed. But most importantly	 they inspire others to keep expanding the circle of mutual		
understanding and respect	 one person at a time.

Even as we work to spread tolerance more broadly	 we also are working to deepen our		
appreciation for the experiences of others. Our 2012 Hours Against Hate initiative encourages			
young people to put themselves in another person's shoes through service projects. So far	 young		
people from all over the world have pledged thousands of volunteer hours to help people from a			
different background	 to see them as a fellow human being	 not a stereotype	 not a caricature
another real live person — people who don't look like you	 live like you	 pray like you	 but with
whom we will share this planet. And therefore	 we have work to do.		
People of faith and conscience are called to be the leaders of tolerance. In my tradition	 like all		
traditions	 we are expected to love one another. And together	 we have to translate that into better	
understanding and cooperation. I'm particularly pleased that the young people you will hear from			
tonight are really setting an example	 not only for young people elsewhere in the world but		
frankly	 for us who are older as well.		
Let me now call to the stage someone who has been a tremendous assistance to me in these			
efforts. Farah Pandith is the Department's first Special Representative to Muslim Communities.			
And from the beginning	 she has made reaching out to young people and civil society her top		
priority. Farah will introduce you to three young leaders who I am very proud of

SECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you very much	 Chaplain. Mr. President	 Mr. Vice President	
Secretary Panetta	 Ambassador Rice	 Secretary Powell and Mrs. Powell	 family members of the
four patriots and heroes we bring home	 members of the State Department family	 ladies and	
gentlemen	 today we bring home four Americans who gave their lives for our country and our

deepest gratitude.			
Sean Smith joined the State Department after six years in the Air Force. He was respected as an			
expert on technology by colleagues in Pretoria	 Baghdad	 Montreal	 and The Hague. He enrolled
in correspondence courses at Penn State and had high hopes for the future. Sean leaves behind a			
loving wife Heather	 two young children	 Samantha and Nathan	 and scores of grieving family
friends	 and colleagues. And that's just in this world. Because online in the virtual worlds that		
Sean helped create	 he is also being mourned by countless competitors	 collaborators	 and garners
who shared his passion.			
Tyrone Woods	 known to most as Rone	 spent two decades as a Navy SEAL	 serving multiple
tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. Since 2010	 he protected American diplomatic personnel in		
dangerous posts from Central America to the Middle East. He had the hands of a healer as well			
as the arms of a warrior	 earning distinction as a registered nurse and certified paramedic. Our		
hearts go out to Tyrone's wife Dorothy	 and his three sons Tyrone	 Jr.	 Hunter
a few months ago	 along with his grieving faii)ily	 friends	 and colleagues.

Glen Doherty	 who went by Bub	 was also a former SEAL and an experienced paramedic. He too	
died as he lived	 serving his country and protecting his colleagues. Glen deployed to some of the		
most dangerous places on Earth	 including Iraq and Afghanistan	 always putting his life on the	
line to safeguard other Americans. Our thoughts and prayers are with Glen's father Bernard	 his		
mother Barbara	 his brother Gregory	 his sister Kathleen	 and their grieving families
colleagues.			
I was honored to know Ambassador Chris Stevens. I want to thank his parents and siblings	 who		
are here today	 for sharing Chris with us and with our country. What a wonderful gift you gave		
us. Over his distinguished career in the Foreign Service	 Chris won friends for the United States		
in far-flung places. He made those people's hopes his own. During the revolution in Libya	 he		
risked his life to help protect the Libyan people from a tyrant	 and he gave his life helping them		
build a better country.			
People loved to work with Chris. And as he rose through the ranks	 they loved to work for Chris.		
He was known not only for his courage but for his smile — goofy but contagious — for his sense			
of fun and that California cool.			
In the days since the attack	 so many Libyans — including the Ambassador from Libya to the		
United States	 who is with us today — have expressed their sorrow and solidarity. One young		
woman	 her head covered and her eyes haunted with sadness	 held up a handwritten sign that said	
Thugs and killers don't represent Benghazi nor Islam	 The President of the Palestinian		
Authority	 who worked closely with Chris when he served in Jerusalem	 sent me a letter	
remembering his energy and integrity	 and deploring — and I quote — ""an act of ugly terror.""		
Many others from across the Middle East and North Africa have offered similar sentiments.			
This has been a difficult week for the State Department and for our country. We've seen the			
heavy assault on our post in Benghazi that took the lives of those brave men. We've seen rage			
and violence directed at American embassies over an awful interne video that we had nothing to			
do with. It is hard for the American people to make sense of that because it is senseless	 and it is		
totally unacceptable.			
The people of Egypt	 Libya	 Yemen	 and Tunisia did not trade the tyranny of a dictator for the
tyranny of a mob. Reasonable people and responsible leaders in these countries need to do			
everything they can to restore security and hold accountable those behind these violent acts. And			
we will	 under the President's leadership	 keep taking steps to protect our personnel around the	
world.			
There will be more difficult days ahead	 but it is important that we don't lose sight of the		
fundamental fact that America must keep leading the world. We owe it to those four men to			
continue the long	 hard work of diplomacy. I am enormously proud of the men and women of the		
State Department. I'm proud of all those across our government	 civilian and military alike	 who

Remarks With Mexican Secretary of Foreign Relations Patricia Espinosa After Their			
Meeting			
18-Sep	2012		
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good afternoon	 everyone. And it is such a pleasure for me to		
welcome my friend and colleague	 Secretary Espinosa	 along with a very distinguished	
delegation of officials from the Mexican Government for this continuation of consultation at the			
highest levels of each of our governments.			
Before I turn to the matters discussed today	 let me give a brief update on the ongoing U.S.		
response to the protests in the Middle East and elsewhere. I'm sure as you know already	 we are		
taking aggressive steps to protect our staffs in embassies and consulates worldwide. That			
includes reviewing our security posture at every post and augmenting it where necessary. And			
we are working closely with the Libyan Government in our efforts to bring to justice those who			
murdered our four American colleagues in Benghazi.			
The FBI is now in Tripoli to join the investigation with Libyan officials	 and there is nothing		
more important to us than ensuring the safety of our American representatives worldwide. At the			
same time	 as I have said to State Department employees	 the incidents of the past week highlight	
how important our work is. The United States must and will remain strongly engaged in the			
world. Our men and women risk their lives in service to our country and our values	 because they		
know that the United States must be a force for peace and progress. That is worth striving and			
sacrificing for	 and nothing that happened last week changes this fundamental fact.		
Now	 turning to our friends and partners in Mexico	 we are always pleased to have a chance to	
discuss matters of mutual interest and concern between us. Mexico is one of our closest friends			
as well as partner on dozens of critical issues. So we talk about every kind of issue you can			
imagine	 from education and healthcare to poverty alleviation to the environment. But today	 we	
focused on a top priority for us both a security.

We just co-chaired the fourth meeting of the U.S.-Mexico Merida High-Level Consultative			
Group. This is the last one we will hold during the Calderon Administration. And I want to offer			
my personal appreciation to President Calderon and to Foreign Secretary Espinosa for their			
leadership and commitment to this partnership and to all on both sides of the border in our			
governments who have been deeply engaged and committed to it. The Merida Initiative			
represents an unprecedented level of security cooperation between Mexico and the United States.			
As our countries continue to deal with the serious challenge of transnational criminal			
organizations	 including drug traffickers	 illegal arms traffickers	 money launderers
gangs that threaten people on both sides of the border	 we well know there is no quick and easy		
way to stop these criminals and bring them to justice. But nevertheless	 during the past now		
nearly four years	 our countries have collaborated to an extraordinary and unprecedented degree.		
We have brought together policy makers and experts from across our governments and societies			
who have worked hand in hand to keep our people safe. And I think the habits of cooperation we			
have built are among our most important achievements	 and we will rely on them for a long time		
to come.			
Today	 our delegations reviewed the gains we've made on key priorities	 including improving	
law enforcement coordination	 reducing the demand for drugs	 modernizing our border	
infrastructure	 strengthening the rule of law	 and building more resilient and empowered	
communities. We also discussed the lessons we've learned and the work that lies ahead in these			
and other areas	 which our joint statement will reflect. I want to underscore how important our		
security relationship with Mexico is to the United States.			
The Government of Mexico and the Mexican people have faced the threat posed by these			
criminals with courage and resolve	 and we remain committed to doing everything we can to		
support Mexico as it continues to work to bring those criminals to justice. This is a transnational			
problem	 and it calls for a transnational solution	 and the United States believes this is a matter of	
shared responsibility. That was the first message I brought as Secretary of State when I came to			
Mexico	 and it continues to be the hallmark of our efforts together. Making sure our people are		
safe and our neighbors are safe is of the utmost importance to us.			
Now	 our two countries share many other priorities	 and one of them	 empowering women and
girls	 was also addressed today. We took the opportunity	 the Foreign Secretary and I	 to sign a
Memorandum of Understanding between our countries to work together to advance gender			
equality	 empower girls and women	 promote their human rights	 and enhance their security.
So again	 Secretary Espinosa	 let me thank you for years of work and effort	 for our productive
conversations in many places around the world and again today	 and for being such a valuable		
colleague and partner. The United States deeply	 deeply values our relationship with Mexico and		
the ties of family and friendship that connect so many millions of our people.

And we look forward to the future. We believe strongly that presidential administrations may			
change	 elections will come and go	 but we have established a firm foundation for cooperation	
that has already benefited both our countries and which will continue to benefit both of our			
countries for many years ahead. So thank you very much.			
MS. NULAND: We'll take (inaudible). Margaret Brennan	 CBS News.		
QUESTION: Madam Secretary	 thanks for your time. Are you any closer to finding who killed		
Ambassador Chris Stevens?	 Libya's President says this attack was planned for months. Are you		
confident he's wrong and that security measures were appropriate? And will you leave justice to			
the Libyans?			
SECRETARY CLINTON: As I said at the outset	 we are taking aggressive steps to protect our		
people and our consulates and embassies around the world. We are reviewing our security			
posture at every post and working with host governments to be sure they know what our security-			
needs are wherever necessary. We are also working closely with the Libyan Government to bring			
the perpetrators to justice so that we can be assured that we have found who murdered our four			
colleagues and under what circumstances. As I said	 the FBI has joined the investigation inside		
Libya	 and we will not rest until the people who orchestrated this attack are found and punished.		
It is also important to look at this strategically and understand what is going on across the region.			
In a number of places where protests have tuned violent	 we are seeing the hand of extremists		
who are trying to exploit people's inflamed passions for their own agendas. But overwhelmingly			
we have found that the people of Egypt	 of Libya	 of Yemen and Tunisia are not prepared to	
trade the tyranny of a dictator for the tyranny of a mob. They want to turn their attention to the			
future to provide better opportunities for themselves and their children	 and they want a strong		
partnership with the United States and the American people based on mutual interests and mutual			
respect.			
This is part of a larger debate that is going on inside these societies. In Libya	 for example	 in	
their first free elections	 moderates were successful at the polls. But look	 there are extremists in	
all of these societies and on the outside who are working to take advantage of broad outrage in			
order to incite violence and specifically incite violence against Americans and American			
facilities.			
And as I have said to many of the leaders I have spoken to over the past week	 these extremist		
efforts are a threat to the people of the societies and the governments of those societies as well as			
to the region and the United States. And I think it's important at this moment for leaders to put			
themselves on the right side of this debate - to speak out clearly and unequivocally against			
violence	 whoever incites it or conducts it		
And in a struggle like this	 there can be no doubt where the United States must stand. We support		
those who are fighting for the same values and rights that we believe in - in democracy	 in

freedom	 in universal rights for men and women	 for justice and accountability. And I want to	
underscore that the United States will continue to work with partners and allies in the region and			
around the world to help bring security to these nations so that the promise of the revolutions that			
they experienced can be realized.			
And finally	 on your specific point about Benghazi	 we obviously never talk publicly about	
security at any of our missions for obvious reasons. But that said	 let me assure you that our		
security in Benghazi included a unit of host government security forces	 as well as a local guard		
force of the kind that we rely on in many places around the world. In addition to the security			
outside the compound	 we relied on a wall and a robust security presence inside the compound.		
And with all of our missions overseas	 in advance of September lid'	 as is done every year	 we
did an evaluation on threat streams. And the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has			
said we had no actionable intelligence that an attack on our post in Benghazi was planned or			
imminent.			
But let me state the obvious again. Our diplomats engage in dangerous work	 and it's the nature		
of diplomacy in fragile societies and conflict zones to be aware of the necessity for security but			
to also continue the important diplomatic work that has to go on. There is risk inherent in what			
we do and what these brave men and women representing the United States are up against every			
single day	 and we do our very best to limit that risk by ensuring that our security protocols		
reflect the environments in which diplomats work and the threats that they are presented with.			
Thank you.			
Remarks With Indonesian Foreign Minister Raden Mohammad Marty Muliana			
Natalegawa After Their Meeting			
20-Sep	2012		
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good afternoon	 everyone. And it's such a pleasure	 as always	 to
welcome the Indonesian Foreign Minister	 and I believe the largest delegation that has ever come		
from Indonesia	 for the purpose of our third meeting of the U.S.-Indonesia Joint Commission.		
This commission is the result of a vision by our two presidents for a comprehensive partnership			
and the agreement to that effect was signed in 2010. Thanks to this partnership	 the United States		
and Indonesia are working more closely than ever on a range of issues from global security to			
clean energy and climate to regional trade and commerce.			
And today	 Marty and I had the chance to take stock of where our teams have come in the time		
of the last year	 because we liad our meeting in Bali a year ago. And I must say	 I was very	
impressed. We covered a great deal today.

But before I start	 I'd like to say a few words about the protests in several countries around the		
world. We have condemned in the strongest possible terms the violence that has erupted from			
these protests. And as I have said	 the video that sparked these protests is disgusting and		
reprehensible	 and the United States Government	 of course	 had absolutely nothing to do with it.
But there is no justification for violence	 and I want to thank the Foreign Minister and his		
government for speaking out against violence. We have to look to reasonable people and			
responsible leaders everywhere to stand up to extremists who would seek to take advantage of			
this moment to commit violent acts against embassies and their fellow countrymen.			
Today's meetings have highlighted the strong foundation that we have built together. And one of			
our most important concerns is promoting peace and stability in the Asia Pacific. Today	 I'm		
announcing that the Obama Administration has informed Congress of the potential sale of eight			
AH-64D Apache Longbow helicopters to the Indonesian Government. This agreement will			
strengthen our comprehensive partnership and help enhance security across the region.			
On growth and prosperity	 we are increasing our trade relationship that topped $26 billion last		
year. Investments in transportation	 energy	 and infrastructure are creating jobs and supporting	
economic growth in both countries. For example	 the deal between Lion Air and Boeing alone		
represents $21 billion in trade over the next decade. Indonesia's Government has announced half			
a trillion dollars in infrastructure improvements	 and we recently signed a memorandum of		
understanding to make it easier for American companies to bid on these projects.			
And yesterday	 we signed an agreement for implementing our Millennium Challenge		
Corporation Compact with Indonesia. Over the next five years	 the United States will invest $600		
million in clean energy development	 child health and nutrition programs	 and efforts to help	
make Indonesia's Government more transparent and open.			
The United States is also looking forward to Indonesia hosting APEC in 2013	 and we are		
confident that Indonesia will come to this role with a commitment to promote greater economic			
integration across the Asia Pacific.			
Both the Foreign Minister and I believe that strong education is essential to compete in a modem			
global economy. That's why the United States has expanded the Fulbright Program and			
supported partnerships between dozens of American and Indonesian universities. Academic			
exchanges between our countries are up and applications from Indonesian students to visit the			
United States have increased by one third. USAID has recently expanded its basic education			
program to provide $83 million for teacher training and literacy programs for young children.			
And we're providing $20 in scholarship funding for Indonesian graduate students.

I also thanked the Minister for Indonesia's leadership in ASEAN. The Foreign Minister's			
personal leadership has helped lay the groundwork for diplomacy between ASEAN and China as			
it relates to the South China Sea. And we continue to support ASEAN's six-point principles			
which we believe will help reduce tensions and pave the way for a comprehensive code of			
conduct for addressing disputes without threats	 coercion	 or use of force.	
Finally. Indonesia and the United States have stood together on a range of global challenges			
from democratic reform in Burma to combating climate change	 to working to end the violence		
in Syria. We are also coordinating efforts to further develop south-south and triangular			
cooperation	 such as enhancing disaster preparedness in Burma and convening a conference on		
women's empowerment.			
We believe that as the second and third-largest democracies in the world	 the United States and		
Indonesia have a special responsibility to promote democracy and human rights. And for the last			
four years	 Indonesia has hosted the Bali Democracy Forum to promote peaceful	 democratic	
transitions through example and open dialogue. Last year	 more than 80 countries attended. And		
once again	 the United States will be sending a high-level delegation.		
So	 Minister	 thank you for everything. Thank you for the great partnership we've had between	
us and between our countries.			
MS. NULAND: We'll take two questions today	 we'll start with Ros Jordan of Al Jazeera		
English.			
QUESTION: Thank you	 Madam Secretary	 Mr. Foreign Minister. Madam Secretary	 my
question is about the ongoing investigation into last week's attack at the consulate in Benghazi.			
You are meeting this afternoon with members of Congress to discuss the progress and the			
concerns that they understandably have. First	 there is the federal mandate to establish an		
accountability review board. Have you done so? Who would you like to see chair it? Are there			
certain questions that you desperately want to have answered in order to safeguard the safety of			
Foreign Service Officers around the world?			
And related to this	 given the political instability and the successes of the past year and a half	 are	
you satisfied that in light of those political changes	 enough was done to protect those working in		
the Middle East and North Africa? And then finally — and this is perhaps going into the area of			
rumor and speculation — but there is at least one report suggesting that Ambassador Stevens felt			
that he was on a	 quote	 ""al-Qaida hit list"" Is this a scurrilous rumor? Is this gallows humor	
when one is working in a period of difficulty and great challenge	 or is there something more to		
what he allegedly — and I stress that word — said?

SECRETARY CLINTON: Well	 first	 let me say I'm looking forward to the opportunity to go	
up to the Congress today. I will be briefing in two separate sessions	 the House and the Senate	 in	
a classified setting	 along with my interagency colleagues	 as we continue to work together	 and
with governments around the world	 to ensure that our people and our facilities are safe. I will be		
joined today by the Director of National Intelligence	 General Clapper	 by the Deputy Secretary	
of Defense	 Ash Carter	 by the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff	 Sandy Winnefeld
along with experts from the FBI	 the State Department	 and elsewhere in the government.	
Now	 I anticipate that this briefing will cover our security posture before and during the events		
and the steps we have taken since to do everything we can with host governments to protect our			
people and our embassies and consulates. The Director of National Intelligence will speak to the			
intelligence issues surrounding these events in Libya. Deputy Secretary Carter will brief on the			
superb support we have had from the U.S. military in the wake of these events	 and we are at the		
very early stages of an FBI investigation. The team from the FBI reached Libya earlier this week.			
And I will advise Congress also that I am launching an accountability review board that will be			
chaired by Ambassador Thomas Pickering.			
I will also talk about the importance of the broader relationships with these countries in light of			
the events of the past days. There are obviously very real challenges in these new democracies			
these fragile societies	 but as I said last week	 the vast majority of the people in these countries	
did not throw off the tyranny of a dictator to trade it for the tyranny of a mob. And we are			
concerned first and foremost with our own people and facilities	 but we are concerned about the		
internal security in these countries because ultimately	 that puts at risk the men	 women	 and
children of these societies on a daily ongoing basis if actions are not taken to try to restore			
security and civil order.			
And let me just conclude by saying that there can be no doubt where the United States stands.			
We continue to support those who are fighting for universal values — values that we see at work			
in Indonesia — the third largest democracy in the world. We believe that these values of universal			
rights	 of justice and accountability	 of democracy	 are there for every person regardless of where
that person might live. So I will look forward to having a chance to talk with members of			
Congress.			
As to your final question	 I have absolutely no information or reason to believe that there's any		
basis for that.			
QUESTION: Thank you.			
MS. NULAND: Last question. Victoria Sidjabat from Tempo Magazine	 please.		
QUESTION: Yes. Madam	 thank you. My question is: Starting today	 U.S. Embassy and	
Consulate are closed in Indonesia as the Muslim movie become wild fireball	 which could be

designed as a weapon to attack U.S. by raising sentiment anti-U.S. from the countries which has			
Muslim majority population like Indonesia.			
Madam Clinton	 how do you see this threat as on the long run? If it's continuing happen	 it's —	
obviously could give impact to the implementation of (inaudible) program in Indonesia. What is			
the reason U.S. Government closed the Embassy and Consulate in Indonesia? What is your			
expectation from Indonesia Government	 for my Minister Marty Natalegawa? How Indonesia		
Government respond to the closing of this Embassy and Consulate	 it's starting today? Is U.S. —		
Indonesia Government has capability to protect U.S. Embassy and Consulate. So the (inaudible)			
program implemented — could be implemented successfully in Indonesia. Thank you.			
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well	 let me begin by saying how grateful we are for the excellent		
cooperation we have received from the Government of Indonesia	 and in particular	 from the law	
enforcement and security institutions in Indonesia. We are very grateful for not only the			
cooperation and protection that has been provided to our facilities	 but also to the strong		
statements condemning violence from the President	 the Foreign Mihister	 and others.	
In consultation with the Government of Indonesia	 we have temporarily	 for tomorrow	 closed
our facilities. We want to be sure that law enforcement in Indonesia has the ability to do what it			
needs to do to make sure that there is no disruption of civil order and security. So we are			
cooperating completely	 and we're very grateful for the strong leadership provided by Indonesia.		
FOREIGN MINISTER NATALEGAWA: Hello	 (inaudible)	 if I may just also respond.	
Precisely as the Secretary had said	 the decision by the United States Government to close		
temporarily its embassies and consulates tomorrow in Indonesia is a decision that's been made			
based on communication and conversation between the authorities in Indonesia and the United			
States as well. So in other words	 it is an informed decision	 a decision that is not intended to	
show any unfriendly intent on the part of anyone	 but it is what it is	 and it's quite some — it's the	
kind of step that governments actually carry out when situations requires it	 even in our case.		
Some of our embassies abroad	 when the situation requires us to have a temporary closing of the		
embassy	 we do that as well. So it is something that is quite regular and something that is		
actually coordinated as well.			
But if I may just broaden the subject matter	 I think as our President had said in the past		
Indonesian Government the Indonesian people	 even	 obviously cannot and would not condone	
the — any acts of violence against diplomatic premises	 against diplomatic personnel	 because	
that is	 truly — would be a challenge to the efficient and a proper conduct of relations among		
states. So that's our point of departure.			
At the same time	 of course	 beyond the immediate issue of protection of the embassies	 we have
still ahead of us the challenge of how to prevent the kind of situations where we are now at in

Remarks With Pakistani Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar Before Their Meeting			
21-Sep	2012		
Good afternoon	 and let me begin by welcoming Foreign Minister Khar on her first visit to		
Washington as foreign minister. We've had the opportunity to meet in Islamabad and other			
settings	 but I am very pleased that we would have this chance to exchange views on our bilateral		
relationship as well as regional and global issues.			
I want to begin by addressing the events of the day and the past week. Today	 we've once again		
seen protests in several cities in Pakistan. Unfortunately	 some of those protests have turned		
violent and	 sadly	 resulted in loss of life. I want to thank the Government of Pakistan for their	
efforts to protect our Embassy in Islamabad and consulates in Lahore	 Peshawar	 and Karachi.	
And I want to be clear	 as I have said on numerous occasions	 the violence we have seen cannot	
be tolerated. There is no justification for violence. Of course	 there is provocation	 and we have	
certainly made clear that we do not in any way support provocation. We found the video that's at			
the core of this series of events offensive	 disgusting	 reprehensible.	
But that does not provide justification for violence	 and therefore it is important for responsible		
leaders	 indeed responsible people everywhere	 to stand up and speak out against violence and	
particularly against those who would exploit this difficult moment to advance their own			
extremist ideologies.			
Yesterday afternoon when I briefed the Congress	 I made it clear that keeping our people		
everywhere in the world safe is our top priority. What happened in Benghazi was a terrorist			
attack	 and we will not rest until we have tracked down and brought to justice the terrorists who		
murdered four Americans. And we are taking aggressive measures at all of our posts to protect			
our staffs and their families along with locally employed people who provide so many important			
contributions to the work of our missions.			
The Foreign Minister and I will have a chance to cover a full range of subjects today	 and it is no		
secret that the past year and a half has been challenging for Pakistan and the United States. And			
we still have work to do to get our bilateral relationship to the point where we would like it to be			
but we both recognize that we can achieve more when we work together on a focused agenda. So

today is the latest in a series of high-level meetings. Ambassador Marc Grossman has just			
returned from consultations in Islamabad. I look forward to seeing President Zardari next week			
at the UN General Assembly. At each meeting	 we are working to identify the strategic goals we		
share — and there are many — and the concrete actions we can each take to accomplish them.			
Our number one shared priority remains pursuing our joint counterterrorism objectives to ensure			
the security of American and Pakistani citizens alike. We face a common threat from a common			
enemy	 and we must confront terrorism and extremism together. Earlier this month	 I designated	
the Haqqani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization so we could make full use of every			
available legal authority to end their deadly attacks. Pakistan's parliament has called for			
expelling foreign fighters so that Pakistan's territory can be fully under control of the Pakistani			
Government and cannot be used to launch attacks against other nations.			
And the follow-through on this is challenging but necessary	 and we look forward to working		
with Pakistan as they continue to address these problems. We have both pledged to support a			
secure	 stable	 and prosperous Afghanistan	 which is vital for the security of the region. And I
want to thank Foreign Minister Khar for Pakistan's reopening of the NATO supply lines to allow			
the movement of goods to Afghanistan.			
We will discuss the successful first meeting of the Safe Passage Working Group in Islamabad			
which brought together Afghan	 Pakistani	 and U.S. representatives to advance the peace process	
in Afghanistan. The Pakistani Government's public call for insurgents to come forward and talk			
with the Afghan Government was particularly important. We are ready to work together to build			
on these steps	 and we will continue our discussions through bilateral consultations and the U.S.-		
Afghanistan-Pakistan Core Group.			
Now	 of course	 our relationship goes far beyond our shared security concerns	 and today we will
discuss the many other ways in which we work together	 particularly to create economic		
opportunity for Pakistanis. Foreign Minister Khar and I agree that we need to shift our economic			
relationship from aid to trade and investment. We are working to help Pakistan attract more			
private sector investment. We hope to finalize a bilateral investment treaty soon. And we've			
created a Pakistan private investment initiative to help more of Pakistan's small and medium			
sized companies get access to capital.			
Over the past few years	 we have seen Pakistan's civilian government begin to put down stronger		
roots. And if elections proceed as planned next year	 it will mark the first time in Pakistan's		
history that a civilian-led government has served its full term. The United States supports			
Pakistan's economic development	 and we have said many times that we want to see democracy		
succeed in Pakistan.

We also support Pakistan's sovereignty	 but we are clear that all sovereign nations carry certain		
obligations to protect the human rights of their citizens	 to control their territory	 to prevent	
threats to their neighbors and the international community.			
So we know that there is still much to be done	 but I can assure the people of Pakistan that the		
United States remains committed to this important relationship and we are confident we can			
continue to move forward together one step at a time to reach our shared strategic objectives.			
Thank you very much.			
Remarks With Tunisian Foreign Minister Rank Abdessalem Before Their Meeting			
21-Sep	2012		
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good morning. I am pleased to welcome the Foreign Minister from			
Tunisia I'm looking forward to our meeting	 We obviously have a great deal to discuss	 and I	
want to thank the Foreign Minister and the Government of Tunisia for their efforts over the last			
week to help secure our Embassy and the American Cooperative School of Tunis following the			
violent assaults of last Friday.			
We are monitoring events closely today. There is no higher priority for President Obama and			
myself than the safety of our people. We've taken a number of steps around the world to			
augment security and to protect our personnel at diplomatic posts. And we are working closely			
with host governments in this effort.			
As I have said before and as is embodied in the Vienna Convention and other international			
agreements	 all governments have the duty	 the solemn duty	 to defend diplomatic missions.
They must be safe and protected places so that governments can exchange views and work on			
many important issues	 and leaders across the world must stand up and be counted in rejecting		
violence and holding violent actors accountable.			
We are working closely with the Government of Tunisia They have assisted us in enhancing the			
security of our facilities. We've also discussed with them the imperative of bringing to justice			
those responsible for these violent attacks. And we have offered and will continue to look for			
ways that we can assist the new Government of Tunisia in ensuring the rule of law throughout			
their country	 first and foremost for the people of Tunisia themselves. We look forward to		
continuing to build our hew partnership with the Tunisian Government and people. Our			
relationship is built around the shared principles of all democracies — a commitment to			
nonviolence	 to tolerance	 and inclusivity for all people	 and to upholding the rule of law.
The Tunisian people have bravely put themselves on the road to democracy. They were the first			
of the Arab revolutions and they have made important progress in a very short period of time.			
They have worked too hard and sacrificed too much over too many years to see their progress			
hijacked at derailed by extremists with Ulric own a5	-.		
			
	encia. And those extreinists	 not only in

Tunisia but in too many places around the world	 look for opportunities to exploit this current		
situation or other situations	 and all people and leaders must stand against them.		
So as the Tunisian Government takes steps to strengthen security and protect the Tunisian people			
and economy from extremism and violent agendas	 the United States stands ready to help. We		
also are working closely with Tunisia on the broader shared threat of terrorism	 including from		
groups like al-Qaida and its affiliates.			
So Minister	 please know the United States remains committed to supporting Tunisia as you deal		
with this current situation	 as you continue your democratic transition	 and we want to be with	
you as you confront challenges and help seize opportunities together for the betterment of the			
future of Tunisia.

going to happen. But that there may be an opening that you can take advantage of to make a case that might otherwise not have been

QUESTION: It's not just women.
SECRETARY CLINTON: But I feel like I've been the same person but in different roles over time. And I appreciate the fact that
people are favorably inclined and supporting what I'm trying to do as Secretary
not. I just have to get up every day and do the best I can.
QUESTION: Do you think there's a difference
SECRETARY CLINTON: Could be. Could be.
QUESTION: But you — do you have a -- do you give it any thought?
SECRETARY CLINTON: I really don't. I really don't.
QUESTION: Okay. Well
and that service is so important to you that
easy as everybody thinks it's going to be. (Laughter.) They think it's going to be there for the taking for you.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Right
ever believe I would run for office. I respected people who did like my husband and supported a lot of candidates over the course of
my adulthood and — actually even before — I was a Goldwater girl when I was — I don't know — whatever glade I was.
So I don't know why it would be surprising that I said
going back to the advocacy community
QUESTION: So you wouldn't start your own foundation since you've got that big apparatus there that's so successful.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well
what we're doing
want to be of service. I believe in service. And one of my mentors
service is the rent we pay for living on this earth
QUESTION: But you're not ruling it out?
SECRETARY CLINTON: I have ruled it out. I have ruled it out. (Laughter.)
QUESTION: Oh
out. (Laughter.)
SECRETARY CLINTON: That's funny.
QUESTION: Seriously. Okay. So is there anything else that — in this action profile about you that you think I've got to include that
I'm missing.

SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah. He's a hard taskmaster.
QUESTION: Isn't he?
SECRETARY CLINTON: I don't know. I'll think about it. I mean

a walk with her. Oh
carrying my little recorder

SECRETARY CLINTON: Oh
QUESTION: Back when she — the two week period she was surging in Iowa at the start of the Republican's — and then she was gone
as all the Republicans popped up and then were gone.
SECRETARY CLINTON: That's funny.

to get into was just the — how you have to be a leader and the muscular part of you versus the compassionate
you
SECRETARY CLINTON: Right.

SECRETARY CLINTON: Well
Middle East. I mean
to be present for the State Department family when we lost four colleagues and do it in a way that was respectful but demonstrating
the emotion that we all felt. So -
QUESTION: Would that be like that video hookup you did with - in -
SECRETARY CLINTON: In Libya? In Tripoli? Probably
QUESTION: Would that be one? Or here?
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well
QUESTION: And then you of course talked to his sister on the phone and stuff like that.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah. So Chris's sister and then went over to - we went out to Andrews early and met all the family
members.
QUESTION: And before you got - somebody told me before you got out of the car on your way to Andrews
to - which country were you on the phone and said
Get your people there""? Oh
excuses."" Was it something like that?
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well
QUESTION: Was it something like that? Would that be accurate?
SECRETARY CLINTON: There were a lot of calls like that. We had a lot of threats.
QUESTION: So you had to be kind of a hard-ass.
SECRETARY CLINTON: We had a lot of threats everywhere. So - and remember
just disappeared after the dictators disappeared. And so there's a difference between some countries where they did not have the
capacity
without the will. So you have to zero in on what the right message is to each of those.
QUESTION: Well
SECRETARY CLINTON: You just have to up the pressure as much as you can.
QUESTION: And how do you do that?
SECRETARY CLINTON: You get everybody you can on the phone
phone
QUESTION: Which country would that have been?
SECRETARY CLINTON: No. No further than that. (Laughter.)
QUESTION: Okay. All right. Okay. And then -
STAFF: That piece of paper was the -
QUESTION: That said she has to go? Because I could keep going to get more detail
STAFF: It's polite. We just set it up that she comes in and gets a blank piece of paper with this - (laughter) -
QUESTION: No
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah. I have to leave for the White House -

QUESTION: Oh
SECRETARY CLINTON: That's funny.
QUESTION: Anyway
seems to be one part of it — your townterviews and then the secretary of cool thing where you came that — it's all kind of this public
persona.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah. Yeah.
QUESTION: The brand of Secretary of State in America. The economic statecraft seemed to me to be part of your —
SECRETARY CLINTON: Right. That's a big part of it.
QUESTION: Okay. And in that —
SECRETARY CLINTON: Internet freedom. I mean
QUESTION: And the Asia focus
SECRETARY CLINTON: My first trip
QUESTION: And then on the Arab Spring
come back to bite you?
SECRETARY CLINTON: No.
QUESTION: Okay.
SECRETARY CLINTON: No. Because I do think that it's — it would be a contortion of who we are not to support people seeking
democracy and freedom and free markets.
QUESTION: Well
mean
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well
still working hard to make sure we live up to our own ideals and values
mean
to do something they've never done before.
And so it is hard. It's something that is going to take time
example of freedom and dignity and human rights
particularly within a revolutionary transition. But I would never have imagined that after something as horrific as the murder of our
four colleagues and the injury of others that you would have a protest — a pro-American protest in Libya demanding that those who
killed Chris Stevens and his colleagues were not the future that Libya wanted. I think that's a remarkable turn of events.
And so we just have to be resolved that we're going to do the best we can to stand for our values
fast changing world
going to have to —
QUESTION: Okay. I understand.
SECRETARY CLINTON: -- head to the White House.
QUESTION: Gotcha.
SECRETARY CLINTON: All right

eve the great religions of the world call us to pursue.			
But that's not what I believe	 and I don't think it's what you believe either here tonight. Part of		
what makes our country so special is we keep trying. We keep working. We keep investing in			
our future. We keep supporting the next generation	 believing that young people can keep us		
moving forward in a positive direction.			
So tonight I think it's important that we talk not just about that better tomorrow that we all seek			
but also about some of the things — the real	 practical	 tangible things — that young people are	
doing to help shape that better future.			
Two years ago in this room	 at our Eid reception	 we launched a program called Generation	
Change to lead a grassroots agenda of positive engagement with Muslim communities. And I			
asked the young Muslim leaders in the audience that night to be our unofficial ambassadors	 to		
help build personal connections	 seek out partners in other countries. And I can report to you		
tonight they did not disappoint. In a few minutes	 you're going to meet some of these young		
leaders	 each with a powerful story to tell.		
The Generation Change network that started in this room now circles the globe. We are building			
an international alliance of young people who want to drive change in their own communities.			
They act as mentors	 spark respectful debates	 simply offer words of encouragement when	
needed. But most importantly	 they inspire others to keep expanding the circle of mutual		
understanding and respect	 one person at a time.

Even as we work to spread tolerance more broadly	 we also are working to deepen our		
appreciation for the experiences of others. Our 2012 Hours Against Hate initiative encourages			
young people to put themselves in another person's shoes through service projects. So far	 young		
people from all over the world have pledged thousands of volunteer hours to help people from a			
different background	 to see them as a fellow human being	 not a stereotype	 not a caricature
another real live person — people who don't look like you	 live like you	 pray like you	 but with
whom we will share this planet. And therefore	 we have work to do.		
People of faith and conscience are called to be the leaders of tolerance. In my tradition	 like all		
traditions	 we are expected to love one another. And together	 we have to translate that into better	
understanding and cooperation. I'm particularly pleased that the young people you will hear from			
tonight are really setting an example	 not only for young people elsewhere in the world but		
frankly	 for us who are older as well.		
Let me now call to the stage someone who has been a tremendous assistance to me in these			
efforts. Farah Pandith is the Department's first Special Representative to Muslim Communities.			
And from the beginning	 she has made reaching out to young people and civil society her top		
priority. Farah will introduce you to three young leaders who I am very proud of.			
Remarks at the Transfer of Remains Ceremony to Honor Those Lost in Attacks in Benghazi	 Libya

four patriots and heroes we bring home	 members of the State Department family	 ladies and	
gentlemen	 today we bring home four Americans who gave their lives for our country and our

deepest gratitude.			
Sean Smith joined the State Department after six years in the Air Force. He was respected as an			
expert on technology by colleagues in Pretoria	 Baghdad	 Montreal	 and The Hague. He enrolled
in correspondence courses at Penn State and had high hopes for the future. Sean leaves behind a			
loving wife Heather	 two young children	 Samantha and Nathan	 and scores of grieving family
friends	 and colleagues. And that's just in this world. Because online in the virtual worlds that		
Sean helped create	 he is also being mourned by countless competitors	 collaborators	 and garners
who shared his passion.			
Tyrone Woods	 known to most as Rone	 spent two decades as a Navy SEAL	 serving multiple
tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. Since 2010	 he protected American diplomatic personnel in		
dangerous posts from Central America to the Middle East. He had the hands of a healer as well			
as the arms of a warrior	 earning distinction as a registered nurse and certified paramedic. Our		
hearts go out to Tyrone's wife Dorothy	 and his three sons Tyrone	 Jr.	 Hunter
a few months ago	 along with his grieving family	 friends	 and colleagues.

Glen Doherty	 who went by Bub	 was also a former SEAL and an experienced paramedic. He too	
died as he lived	 serving his country and protecting his colleagues. Glen deployed to some of the		
most dangerous places on Earth	 including Iraq and Afghanistan	 always putting his life on the	
line to safeguard other Americans. Our thoughts and prayers are with Glen's father Bernard	 his		
mother Barbara	 his brother Gregory	 his sister Kathleen	 and their grieving families
colleagues.			
I was honored to know Ambassador Chris Stevens. I want to thank his parents and siblings	 who		
are here today	 for sharing Chris with us and with our country. What a wonderful gift you gave		
us. Over his distinguished career in the Foreign Service	 Chris won friends for the United States		
in far-flung places. He made those people's hopes his own. During the revolution in Libya	 he		
risked his life to help protect the Libyan people from a tyrant	 and he gave his life helping them		
build a better cowl			
People loved to work with Chris. And as he rose through the ranks	 they loved to work for Chris.		
He was known not only for his courage but for his smile — goofy but contagious — for his sense			
of fun and that California cool.			
In the days since the attack	 so many Libyans — including the Ambassador from Libya to the		
United States	 who is with us today — have expressed their sorrow and solidarity. One young		
woman	 her head covered and her eyes haunted with sadness	 held up a handwritten sign that said	
Thugs and killers don't represent Benghazi nor Islam."" The President of the Palestinian			
Authority	 who worked closely with Chris when he served in Jerusalem	 sent me a letter	
remembering his energy and integrity	 and deploring — and I quote — ""an act of ugly terror.""		
Many others from across the Middle East and North Africa have offered similar sentiments.			
This has been a difficult week for the State Department and for our country. We've seen the			
heavy assault on our post in Benghazi that took the lives of those brave men. We've seen rage			
and violence directed at American embassies over an awful internet video that we had nothing to			
do with. It is hard for the American people to make sense of that because. it is senseless	 and it is		
totally unacceptable.			
The people of Egypt	 Libya	 Yemen	 and Tunisia did not trade the tyranny of a dictator for the
tyranny of a mob. Reasonable people and responsible leaders in these countries need to do			
everything they can to restore security and hold accountable those behind these violent acts. And			
we will	 under the President's leadership	 keep taking steps to protect our personnel around the	
world.			
There will be more difficult days ahead	 but it is important that we don't lose sight of the		
fundamental fact-that America must keep leading the world. We owe it to those four men to			
continue the long	 hard work of diplomacy. I am enormously proud of the men and women of the		
State Department. I'm proud of all those across our government	 civilian and military alike	 who

Remarks With Mexican Secretary of Foreign Relations Patricia Espinosa After Their			
Meeting			
18-Sep	2012		
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good afternoon	 everyone. And it is such a pleasure for me to		
welcome my friend and colleague	 Secretary Espinosa	 along with a very distinguished	
delegation of officials from the Mexican Government for this continuation of consultation at the			
highest levels of each of our governments.			
Before I turn to the matters discussed today	 let me give a brief update on the ongoing U.S.		
response to the protests in the Middle East and elsewhere. I'm sure as you know already	 we are		
taking aggressive steps to protect our staffs in embassies and consulates worldwide. That			
includes reviewing our security posture at every post and augmenting it where necessary. And			
we are working closely with the Libyan Government in our efforts to bring to justice those who			
murdered our four American colleagues in Benghazi.			
The FBI is now in Tripoli to join the investigation with Libyan officials	 and there is nothing		
more important to us than ensuring the safety of our American representatives worldwide. At the			
same time	 as I have said to State Department employees	 the incidents of the past week highlight	
how important our work is. The United States must and will remain strongly engaged in the			
world. Our men and women risk their lives in service to our country and our values	 because they		
know that the United States must be a force for peace and progress. That is worth striving and			
sacrificing for	 and nothing that happened last week changes this fundamental fact.		
Now	 turning to our friends and partners in Mexico	 we are always pleased to have a chance to	
discuss matters of mutual interest and concern between us. Mexico is one of our closest friends			
as well as partner on dozens of critical issues. So we talk about every kind of issue you can			
imagine	 from education and healthcare to poverty alleviation to the environment. But today	 we	
focused on a top priority for us both — security.

We just co-chaired the fourth meeting of the U.S.-Mexico Merida High-Level Consultative			
Group. This is the last one we will hold during the Calderon Administration. And I want to offer			
my personal appreciation to President Calderon and to Foreign Secretary Espinosa for their			
leadership and commitment to this partnership and to all on both sides of the border in our			
governments who have been deeply engaged and committed to it. The Merida Initiative			
represents an unprecedented level of security cooperation between Mexico and the United States.			
As our countries continue to deal with the serious challenge of transnational' criminal			
organizations	 including drug traffickers	 illegal arms traffickers	 money launderers
gangs that threaten people on both sides of the border	 we well know there is no quick and easy		
way to stop these criminals and bring them to justice. But nevertheless	 during the past now		
nearly four years	 our countries have collaborated to an extraordinary and unprecedented degree.		
We have brought together policy makers and experts from across our governments and societies			
who have worked hand in hand to keep our people safe. And I think the habits of cooperation we			
have built are among our most important achievements	 and we will rely on them for a long time		
to come.			
Today	 our delegations reviewed the gains we've made on key priorities	 including improving	
law enforcement coordination	 reducing the demand for drugs	 modernizing our border	
infrastructure	 strengthening the rule of law	 and building more resilient and empowered	
communities. We also discussed the lessons we've learned and the work that lies ahead in these			
and other areas. which our joint statement will reflect. I want to underscore how important our			
security relationship with Mexico is to the United States.			
The Government of Mexico and the Mexican people have faced the threat posed by these			
criminals with courage and resolve	 and we remain committed to doing everything we can to		
support Mexico as it continues to work to bring those criminals to justice. This is a transnational			
problem	 and it calls for a transnational solution	 and the United States believes this is a matter of	
shared responsibility. That was the first message I brought as Secretary of State when I came to			
Mexico	 and it continues to be the hallmark of our efforts together. Making sure our people are		
safe and our neighbors are safe is of the utmost importance to us.			
Now	 our two countries share many other priorities	 and one of them	 empowering women and
girls	 was also addressed today. We took the opportunity	 the Foreign Secretary and I	 to sign a
Memorandum of Understanding between our countries to work together to advance gender			
equality	 empower girls and women	 promote their human rights	 and enhance their security.
So again	 Secretary Espinosa	 let me thank you for years of work and effort	 for our productive
conversations in many places around the world and again today	 and for being such a valuable		
colleague and partner. The United States deeply	 deeply values our relationship with Mexico and		
the ties of family and friendship that connect so many millions of our people.

And we look forward to the future. We believe strongly that presidential administrations may			
change	 elections will come and go	 but we have established a firm foundation for cooperation	
that has already benefited both our countries and which will continue to benefit both of our			
countries for many years ahead. So thank you very much.			
MS. NULAND: We'll take (inaudible)	 Margaret Brennan	 CBS News.	
QUESTION: Madam Secretary	 thanks for your time. Are you any closer to finding who killed		
Ambassador Chris Stevens?libya's President says this attack was planned for months. Are you			
confident he's wrong and that security measures were appropriate? And will you leave justice to			
the Libyans?			
SECRETARY CLINTON: As I said at the outset	 we are taking aggressive steps to protect our		
people and our consulates and embassies around the world. We are reviewing our security			
posture at every post and working with host govenunents to be sure they know what our security			
needs are wherever necessary. We are also working closely with the Libyan Government to bring			
the perpetrators to justice so that we can be assured that we have found who murdered our four			
colleagues and under what circumstances. As I said	 the FBI has joined the investigation inside		
Libya	 and we will not rest until the people who orchestrated this attack are found and punished.		
It is also important to look at this strategically and understand what is going on across the region.			
In a number of places where protests have turned violent	 we are seeing the hand of extremists		
who are trying to exploit people's inflamed passions for their own agendas. But overwhelmingly			
we have found that the people of Egypt	 of Libya	 of Yemen and Tunisia are not prepared to	
trade the tyranny of a dictator for the tyranny of a mob. They want to turn their attention to the			
future to provide better opportunities for themselves and their children	 and they want a strong		
partnership with the United States and the American people based on mutual interests and mutual			
respect.			
This is part of a larger debate that is going on inside these societies. In Libya	 for example	 in	
their first free elections	 moderates were successful at the polls. But look	 there are extremists in	
all of these societies and on the outside who are working to take advantage of broad outrage in			
order to incite violence and specifically incite violence against Americans and American			
facilities.			
And as I have said to many of the leaders I have spoken to over the past week	 these extremist		
efforts are a threat to the people of the societies and the governments of those societies as well as			
to the region and the United States. And I think it's important at this moment for leaders to put			
themselves on the right side of this debate — to speak out clearly and unequivocally against

freedom	 in universal rights for men and women	 for justice and accountability	 And I want to
underscore that the United States will continue to work with partners and allies in the region and			
around the world to help bring security to these nations so that the promise of the revolutions that			
they experienced can be realized.			
And finally	 on your specific point about Benghazi	 we obviously never talk publicly about	
security at any of our missions for obvious reasons. But that said	 let me assure you that our		
security in Benghazi included a unit of host government security forces	 as well as a local guard		
force of the kind that we rely on in many places around the world. In addition to the security			
outside the compound	 we relied on a wall and a robust security presence inside the compound.		
And with all of our missions overseas	 in advance of September 11th	 as is done every year we	
did an evaluation on threat streams. And the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has			
said we had no actionable intelligence that an attack on our post in Benghazi was planned or			
imminent.			
But let me state the obvious again. Our diplomats engage in dangerous work	 and it's the nature		
of diplomacy in fragile societies and conflict zones to be aware of the necessity for security but			
to also continue the important diplomatic work that has to go on. There is risk inherent in what			
we do and what these brave men and women representing the United States are up against every			
single day	 and we do our very best to limit that risk by ensuring that our security protocols		
reflect the environments in which diplomats work and the threats that they are presented with.			
Thank you.			
Remarks With Indonesian Foreign Minister Raderi Mohammad Marty Miliaria			
Natalegawa After Their Meeting			
20-Sep	2012		
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good afternoon. everyone. And it's such a pleasure	 as always	 to	
welcome the Indonesian Foreign Minister	 and I believe the largest delegation that has ever come		
from Indonesia	 for the purpose of our third meeting of the U.S.-Indonesia Joint Commission.		
This commission is the result of a vision by our two presidents for a comprehensive partnership			
and the agreement to that effect was signed in 2010. Thanks to this partnership	 the United States		
and Indonesia are working more closely than ever on a range of issues from global security to			
clean energy and climate to regional trade and commerce.			
And today	 Marty and I had the chance to take stock of where our teams have come in the time		
of the last year	 because we had our meeting in Bali a year ago. And I must say	 I was very	
impressed. We covered a great deal today

But before I start	 I'd like to say a few words about the protests in several countries around the		
world. We have condemned in the strongest possible terms the violence that has erupted from			
these protests. And as I have said	 the video that sparked these protests is disgusting and		
reprehensible	 and the United States Government	 of course	 had absolutely nothing to do with it.
But there is no justification for violence	 and I want to thank the Foreign Minister and his		
government for speaking out against violence. We have to look to reasonable people and			
responsible leaders everywhere to stand up to extremists who would seek to take advantage of			
this moment to commit violent acts against embassies and their fellow countrymen.			
Today's meetings have highlighted the strong foundation that we have built together. And one of			
our most important concerns is promoting peace and stability in the Asia Pacific. Today	 I'm		
announcing that the Obama Administration has informed Congress of the potential sale of eight			
AH-64D Apache Longbow helicopters to the Indonesian Government. This agreement will			
strengthen our comprehensive partnership and help enhance security across the region.			
On growth and prosperity	 we are increasing our trade relationship that topped $26 billion last		
year. Investments in transportation	 energy	 and infrastructure are creating jobs and supporting	
economic growth in both countries. For example	 the deal between Lion Air and Boeing alone		
represents $21 billion in trade over the next decade. Indonesia's Government has announced half			
a trillion dollars in infrastructure improvements	 and we recently signed a memorandum of		
understanding to make it easier for American companies to bid on these projects.			
And yesterday	 we signed an agreement for implementing our Millennium Challenge		
Corporation Compact with Indonesia. Over the next five years	 the United States will invest $600		
million in clean energy development	 child health and nutrition programs	 and efforts to help	
make Indonesia's Government more transparent and open.			
The United States is also looking forward to Indonesia hosting APEC in 2013	 and we are		
confident that Indonesia will come to this role with a commitment to promote greater economic			
integration across the Asia Pacific.			
Both the Foreign Minister and I believe that strong education is essential to compete in a modem			
global economy. That's why the United States has expanded the Fulbright Program and			
supported partnerships between dozens of American and Indonesian universities. Academic			
exchanges between our countries are up and applications from Indonesian students to visit the			
United States have increased by one third. USAID has recently expanded its basic education			
program to provide $83 million for teacher training and literacy programs for young children.			
And we're providing $20 in scholarship funding for Indonesian graduate students.

I also thanked the Minister for Indonesia's leadership in ASEAN. The Foreign Minister's			
personal leadership has helped lay the groundwork for diplomacy between ASEAN and China as			
it relates to the South China Sea. And we continue to support ASEAN's six-point principles			
which we believe will help reduce tensions and pave the way for a comprehensive code of			
conduct for addressing disputes without threats	 coercion	 or use of force.	
Finally	 Indonesia and the United States have stood together on a range of global challenges		
from democratic reform in Burma to combating climate change	 to working to end the violence		
in Syria. We are also coordinating efforts to further develop south-south and triangular			
cooperation	 such as enhancing disaster preparedness in Burma and convening a conference on		
women's empowerment.			
We believe that as the second and third-largest democracies in the world	 the United States and		
Indonesia have a special responsibility to promote democracy and human rights. And for the last			
four years	 Indonesia has hosted the Bali Democracy Forum to promote peaceful	 democratic	
transitions through example and open dialogue. Last year	 more than 80 countries attended. And		
once again	 the United States will be sending a high-level delegation.		
So	 Minister	 thank you for everything. Thank you for the great partnership we've had between	
us and between our countries.			
MS. NULAND: We'll take two questions today	we'll start with Ros Jordan of Al Jazeera		
English.			
QUESTION: Thank you	 Madam Secretary	 Mr. Foreign Minister. Madam Secretary	 my
question is about the ongoing investigation into last week's attack at the consulate in Benghazi.			
You are meeting this afternoon with members of Congress to discuss the progress and the			
concerns that they understandably have. First	 there is the federal mandate to establish an		
accountability review board. Have you done so? Who would you like to see chair it? Are there			
certain questions that you desperately want to have answered in order to safeguard the safety of			
Foreign Service Officers around the world?			
And related to this	 given the political instability and the successes of the past year and a half	 are	
you satisfied that in light of those political changes	 enough was done to protect those working in		
the Middle East and North Africa? And then finally — and this is perhaps going into the area of			
rumor and speculation — but there is at least one report suggesting that Ambassador Stevens felt			
that he was on a	 quote	 ""al-Qaida hit list."" Is this a scurrilous rumor? Is this gallows humor	
when one is working in a period of difficulty and great challenge	 or is there something more to		
what he allegedly — and I stress that word — said?

SECRETARY CLINTON: Well	 first	 let me say I'm looking forward to the opportunity to go	
up to the Congress today. I will be briefing in two separate sessions	 the House and the Senate	 in	
a classified setting	 along with my interagency colleagues	 as we continue to work together	 and
with governments around the world	 to ensure that our people and our facilities are safe. I will be		
joined today by the Director of National Intelligence	 General Clapper	 by the Deputy Secretary	
of Defense	 Ash Carter	 by the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff	 Sandy Witmefeld
along with experts from the FBI	 the State Department	 and elsewhere in the government.	
Now	 I anticipate that this briefing will cover our security posture before and during the events		
and the steps we have taken since to do everything we can with host governments to protect our			
people and our embassies and consulates. The Director of National Intelligence will speak to the			
intelligence issues surrounding these events in Libya. Deputy Secretary Carter will brief on the			
superb support we have had from the U.S. military in the wake of these events	 and we are at the		
very early stages of an FBI investigation. The team from the FBI reached Libya earlier this week.			
And I will advise Congress also that I am launching an accountability review board that will be			
chaired by Ambassador Thomas Pickering.			
I will also talk about the importance of the broader relationships with these countries in light of			
the events of the past days. There are obviously very real challenges in these new democracies			
these fragile societies	 but as I said last week	 the vast majority of the people in these countries	
did not throw off the tyranny of a dictator to trade it for the tyranny of a mob. And we are			
concerned first and foremost with our own people and facilities	 but we are concerned about the		
internal security in these countries because ultimately	 that puts at risk the men	 women	 and
children of these societies on a daily ongoing basis if actions are not taken to try to restore			
security and civil order.			
And let me just conclude by saying that there can be no doubt where the United States stands.			
We continue to support those who are fighting for universal values — values that we see at work			
in Indonesia — the third largest democracy in the world. We believe that these values of universal			
rights	 of justice and accountability	 of democracy	 are there for every person regardless of where
that person might live. So I will look forward to having a chance to talk with members of			
Congress.			
As to your final question	 I have absolutely no information or reason to believe that there's any		
basis for that.			
QUESTION: Thank you.			
MS. NULAND: Last question. Victoria Sidjabat from Tempo Magazine	 please.

designed as a weapon to attack U.S. by raising sentiment anti-U.S. from the countries which has			
Muslim majority population like Indonesia.			
Madam Clinton	 how do you see this threat as on the long run? If it's continuing happen	 it's	
obviously could give impact to the implementation of (inaudible) program in Indonesia. What is			
the reason U.S. Government closed the Embassy and Consulate in Indonesia? What is your			
expectation from Indonesia Government	 for my Minister Marty Natalegawa? How Indonesia		
Government respond to the closing of this Embassy and Consulate	 it's starting today? Is U.S. -		
Indonesia Government has Capability to protect U.S. Embassy and Consulate. So the (inaudible)			
program implemented - could be implemented successfidly in Indonesia. Thank you			
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well	 let me begin by saying how grateful we are for the excellent		
cooperation we have received from the Government of Indonesia	 and in particular	 from the law	
enforcement and security institutions in Indonesia. We are very grateful for not only the			
cooperation and protection that has been provided to our facilities	 but also to the strong		
statements condemning violence from the President	 the Foreign Minister	 and others.	
In consultation with the Government of Indonesia	 we have temporarily	 for tomorrow	 closed
our facilities. We want to be sure that law enforcement in Indonesia has the ability to do what it			
needs to do to make sure that there is no disruption of civil order and security. So we are			
cooperating completely	 and we're very grateful for the strong leadership provided by Indonesia.		
FOREIGN MINIStER NATALEGAWA: Hello	 (inaudible)	 if I may just also respond.	
Precisely as the Secretary had said	 the decision by the United States Government to close		
temporarily its embassies and consulates tomorrow in Indonesia is a decision that's been made			
based on communication and conversation between the authorities in Indonesia and the United			
States as well. So in other words	 it is an informed decision	 a decision that is not intended to	
show any unfriendly intent on the part of anyone	 but it is what it is	 and it's quite some - it's the	
kind of step that governments actually carry out when situations requires it	 even in our case.		
Some of our embassies abroad	 when the situation requires us to have a temporary closing of the		
embassy	 we do that as well. So it is something that is quite regular and something that is		
actually coordinated as well.			
But if I may just broaden the subject matter	 I think as our President had said in the past		
Indonesian Government - the Indonesian people	 even	 obviously cannot and would not condone	
the - any acts of violence against diplomatic premises	 against diplomatic personnel	 because	
that is	 truly - would be a challenge to the efficient and a proper conduct of relations among		
states. So that's our point of departure.			
At the same time	 of course	 beyond the immediate issue of protection of the embassies	 we have
still ahead of us the challenge of how to prevent the kind of situations where we are now at in

terms of the kind of incendiary and the kind of statements or	 in this instance	 films that cause —

Remarks With Pakistani Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar Before Their Meeting			
21-Sep	2012		
Good afternoon	 and let me begin by welcoming Foreign Minister Khar on her first visit to		
Washington as foreign minister. We've had the opportunity to meet in Islamabad and other			
settings	 but I am very pleased that we would have this chance to exchange views on our bilateral		
relationship as well as regional and global issues.			
I want to begin by addressing the events of the day and the past week. Today	 we've once again		
seen protests in several cities in Pakistan. Unfortunately	 some of those protests have turned		
violent and	 sadly	 resulted in loss of life. I want to thank the Government of Pakistan for their	
efforts to protect our Embassy in Islamabad and consulates in Lahore	 Peshawar	 and Karachi.	
And I want to be clear	 as I have said on numerous occasions	 the violence we have seen cannot	
be tolerated. There is no justification for violence. Of course	 there is provocation	 and we have	
certainly made clear that we do not in any way support provocation We found the video that's at			
the core of this series of events offensive	 disgusting	 reprehensible.	
But that does not provide justification for violence	 and therefore it is important for responsible		
leaders	 indeed responsible people everywhere	 to stand up and speak out against violence and	
particularly against those who would exploit this difficult moment to advance their own			
extremist ideologies.			
Yesterday afternoon when I briefed the Congress	 I made it clear that keeping our people		
everywhere in the world safe is our top priority. What happened in Benghazi was a terrorist			
attack	 and we will not rest until we have tracked down and brought to justice the terrorists who		
murdered four Americans. And we are taking aggressive measures at all of our posts to protect			
our staffs and their families along with locally employed people who provide so many important			
contributions to the work of our missions.			
The Foreign Minister and I will have a chance to cover a full range of subjects today	 and it is no		
secret that the past year and a half has been challenging for Pakistan and the United States. And			
we still have work to do to get our bilateral relationship to the point where we would like it to be			
but ‘ve 1			
			
-)oth recognize that we can achieve rnol'e \x/hen we work together on a focused agenda. So

today is the latest in a series of high-level meetings. Ambassador Marc Grossman has just			
returned from consultations in Islamabad. I look forward to seeing President Zardari next week			
at the UN General Assembly. At each meeting	 we are working to identify the strategic goals we		
share — and there are many — and the concrete actions we can each take to accomplish them.			
Our number one shared priority remains pursuing our joint counterterrorism objectives to ensure			
the security of American and Pakistani citizens alike. We face a common threat from a common			
enemy	 and we must confront terrorism and extremism together. Earlier this Month	 I designated	
the Haggani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization so we could make full use of every			
available legal authority to end their deadly attacks. Pakistan's parliament has called for			
expelling foreign fighters so that Pakistan's territory can be fully under control of the Pakistani			
Government and cannot be used to launch attacks against other nations.			
And the follow-through on this is challenging but necessary	 and we look forward to working		
with Pakistan as they continue to address these problems. We have both pledged to support a			
secure	 stable	 and prosperous Afghanistan	 which is vital for the security of the region. And I
want to thank Foreign Minister Khar for Pakistan's reopening of the NATO supply lines to allow			
the movement of goods to Afghanistan.			
We will discuss the successful first meeting of the Safe Passage Working Group in Islamabad			
which brought together Afghan	 Pakistani	 and U.S. representatives to advance the peace process	
in Afghanistan. The Pakistani Government's public call for insurgents to come forward and talk			
with the Afghan Government was particularly important. We are ready to work together to build			
on these steps	 and we will continue OUT discussions through bilateral consultations and the U.S.-		
Afghanistan-Pakistan Core Group.			
Now	 of course	 our relationship goes far beyond our shared security concerns	 and today we will
discuss the many other ways in which we work together	 particularly to create economic		
opportunity for Pakistanis. Foreign Minister Khar and I agree that we need to shift our economic			
relationship front aid to trade and investment. We are working to help Pakistan attract more			
private sector investment We hope to finalize a bilateral investment treaty soon. And we've			
created a Pakistan private investment initiative to help more of Pakistan's small and medium			
sized companies get access to capital.			
Over the past few years	 we have seen Pakistan's civilian government begin to put down stronger		
roots. And if elections proceed as planned next year	 it will mark the first time in Pakistan's		
history that a civilian-led government has served its full term. The United States supports			
Pakistan's economic development	 and we have said many times that we want to see democracy		
succeed in Pakistan.

We also support Pakistan's sovereignty	 but we are clear that all sovereign nations carry certain		
obligations to protect the human rights of their citizens	 to control their territory	 to prevent	
threats to their neighbors and the international community.			
So we know that there is still much to be done	 but I can assure the people of Pakistan that the		
United States remains committed to this important relationship and we are confident we can			
continue to move forward together one step at a time to reach our shared strategic objectives.			
Thank you very much.			
Remarks With Tunisian Foreign Minister Rafik Ahdessalem Before Their Meeting			
21-Sep	2012		
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good morning. I am pleased to welcome the Foreign Minister from			
Tunisia. I'm looking forward to our meeting. We obviously have a great deal to discuss	 and I		
want to thank the Foreign Minister and the Government of Tunisia for their efforts over the last			
week to help secure our Embassy and the American Cooperative School of Tunis following the			
violent assaults of last Friday.			
We are monitoring events closely today. There is no higher priority for President ()barna and			
myself than the safety of our people. We've taken a number of steps around the world to			
augment security and to protect our personnel at diplomatic posts. And we are working closely			
with host governments in this effort.			
As I have said before and as is embodied in the Vienna Convention and other international			
agreements	 all governments have the duty	 the solemn duty	 to defend diplomatic missions.
They must be safe and protected places so that governments can exchange views and work on			
many important issues	 and leaders across the world must stand up and be counted in rejecting		
violence and holding violent actors accountable.			
We are working closely with the Government of Tunisia. They have assisted us in enhancing the			
security of our facilities. We've also discussed with them the imperative of bringing to justice			
those responsible for these violent attacks. And we have offered and will continue to look for			
ways that we can assist the new Government of Tunisia in ensuring the rule of law throughout			
their country	 first and foremost for the people of Tunisia themselves. We look forward to		
continuing to build our new partnership with the Tunisian Government and people. Our			
relationship is built around the shared principles of all democracies — a commitment to			
nonviolence	 to tolerance	 and inelusivity for all people	 and to upholding the rule of law.
The Tunisian people have bravely put themselves on the road to democracy. They were the first			
of the Arab revolutions and they have made important progress in a very short period of time.			
They have worked too hard and sacrificed too much over too many years to see their progress			
hijacked or derailed by extremists with their own agenda. And those extremists	 not only in

Tunisia but in too many places around the world	 look for opportunities to exploit this current		
situation or other situations	 and all people and leaders must stand against them.		
So as the Tunisian Government takes steps to strengthen security and protect the Tunisian people			
and economy from extremism and violent agendas	 the United States stands ready to help. We		
also are working closely with Tunisia on the broader shared threat of terrorism	 including from		
groups like al-Qaida and its affiliates.			
So Minister	 please know the United States remains committed to supporting Tunisia as you deal		
with this current situation	 as you continue your democratic transition	 and we want to be with	
you as you confront challenges and help seize opportunities together for the betterment of the			
future of Tunisia.
